<h3>Conference Call History</h3>
A Conference call, or multi party phone connections has roots in what was known as a party line.  In this setup a phone call was physically connected to multiple handsets by wires where more
than one handset could be picked up at a time.  In some rural areas households phones are still setup in this fashion where RJ11 analog is terminated at multiple handsets in a single or multiple
dwelling including barns and outhouses.  As time went on many households moved away from a 'lan' or LAND line and to save money have moved primarily to mobiles, handys, or as are referred to
in the U.S. 'Cell Phones'.  Now we have a problem, there are no physical connections to pickup up multiple handsets as the wires are missing!  This is where Conference Calls come in.  Today we Use
VoIP (Voice Over IP = Internet Protocol) to make these connections but just a few years ago a PBX (Private Branch Exchange) would have been used. Ginormous companies like Cisco and Polycom 
showed up to offer hardware for the small business owner to host their own phone systems and conduct their own conference calls, but these are now irrelevant and the decline in their stock
price and user base reflects this shift.  Internet VoIP based conference calls allow anyone, anywhere throughout the world to conduct multi party conversations where with only one loss of function,
the NSA and other world TLA (Three Letter Agencies) are able to monitor and influence the direction of business.  These tools are so powerful, even the global conglomerate Microsoft saw the 
power in this and purchased Skype for 8.5 BILLION dollars in 2011.  <br><br>

<hr class="inner-row">   <br>   
<h3>Robocallers, Telemarketers and Scammers - the VoIP black hole</h3>
Today - VoIP services are often abused to connect multiple parties, but not the ones you may intend. Fishing and other scrud services are often initiated by robo (robotic) dialers built on 
the very free services listed below where less than ethical organizations harass a perfectly good cell phone by spoofing origination from the same prefix so you think it is from someone
in your area just so they can contact you for Telemarketing, fake Alerts and Reminders, fake Payments and Scams.  in these call you are typically asked about, virus scanning, solar installation, 
money transfers, possible IRS violation and other stupid scams.  but as P.T. Barnum says "there is a sucker born ever minute" - or was it the con man Paper Collar Joe? at any rate, you only 
have to be a sucker once, or once in 10,000 times for these fools to be profitable, so it can get very frustrating.<br><br>


<h3>.. A little more history</h3><br>
Starting in 2004, with the mass adoption of VOIP technology, which had been in development since 1973 - connecting unproductive business men for free was now possible. VocalTec started in 1995
and when launched, joined microsoft NetMeeting as some of the first mainstream offerings.  by 1998 Vocaltec could claim about 1% of all voice traffic.  By 2003, VOIP traffic accounted for about
25% of all traffick, but the growth trajectory was not over yet. Skype beta launched in 2003 allowing people to call for free but working best with emerging broadband connections including DSL and ISDN.
Skype was and remains closed source, limited access to servers, but the call of cheap and free trumped that and popularity continues to soar.  <br><br>

<h3>lots and lotsa companies</h3><br>
oOma, Vonage, MagicJack, Grasshopper, RingCentral, Nextiva are just the beginning. if you haven't joined the bandwagon yet, consider the following:<br><br>
