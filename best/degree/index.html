<h3>Academic Degree History</h3>
A Degree or certificate of succesfful completion is given typically when one completes a form of higher education, historically known as college or university study
but now also known as a 'degree'.  A basic degree, AS or Associates is typically a 2 year degree and the easiest way after high school or GED completion in the U.S. 
but successful completion of high school, or grade 12 is not always requried.  Associates Degrees often award in Associate of Arts, Associate of Science, or Associate 
of applied science. They can also be earned in nursing, medical technology and phramacuitacal, and electronics and drafting.  <Br><br>

4-year degrees, or Bachelors typically take 4 years to complete, except for some of the harder areas or study that may average over 5 years to complete a '4-year' 
degree in engineering, such as a BSe (engineering).  This is generally considered the standard college degree and opens most doors in the U.S. to gainful employment.
<br><br>
Advanced Degrees include Masters, or PHd (doctorate) where most fields of study terminate ina PHd, some only have content through a masters level.  a PhD in sciences
and engineering can take an additional 3-6 years after successful completion of undergraduate (4-year college) degree is earned.  Stangeley enough, Advanced
degrees do not require successful completion of their topic in the 4-year program to be be considered, attend and complete and advanced terminal degree. for example
it could be technically possible to complete a 4-year degree in greenhouse coldframe administration to then go on and complete a doctorate in Mars Teraforming
and Rover engineering.  <br><Br>

In many parts of the world, 5 years of education is completed before entering the workforce - it is unforunate that many cultures do not afford the time or money
for childern to attend school for advanced learning, but are forced to enter the workforce as soon as possible for basic survival.  This is particulalry problematic
for women and girls who are often the most undereducation portion of the population.  Many parts of the world have 8 years of education as a luctury and even
a 12 year high school degree in the U.S. would be a luctury.  <br><br>

For most first world countries, graduate and advanced degrees are achieved by a signficant portion of the population. as of 2012 about 8 percent of the population
achieved a Masters Degree (united states).  In many professions, the difference between a 4-year batcheolors and a masters degree in the same topic is can account for almost 25%
wage increase in that field.  

<hr class="inner-row">   <br>   
<h3>Debt in education</h3><br>
Unfortunately - most students and their sponsoring families are unable to pay the high cost of tuition (and other fees) to get a basic or advanced degree.  Some are
eligible for scholarships (sports, high grades, music, arts,etc) but many take private or public loans to pay for their degrees.  In many cases this debt is carried
for 5-20 years AFTER a student graduates because government loans are not possible to clear with bankruptcy.  This can be extemely problematic for new graduates
as their lifetime earning potential is greatly improved, but it will take years for them to have an income stream to overcome the debt they took on to achieve the degree.
As many working professionals progress through their career, they can command a higher salary and only live with a higher disposable income towards the end of their
careers which is counter intuitive for many as they are taught becomeing a doctor is a road to immediate success but it may not be. The best way to avoid excess Debt
is to not pursue a degree based of prestige unless you are in a position to fully take advantage of the social network you are paying for, but instead achieve basic
education through the most economical means possible such as in state community college and then transfering to an instate university.  Many are attracted to the 
the name of a well known institution and want to start there, but there are much less expensive ways to achieve nearly exactly the same thign.  Pay attention to the 
underlying accredidation of the school and program you are enrolled in, particularly to the instutiton you will get the diploam from.  note that in many cases the accreditation
is exactly the same as much higher costing institutions and as such the quality of educaiton is often very close.  An employer will be attracted to high name Degrees
but an astute employer will look a the accredidation and make sure htat is sound to recognize the degree when a school is lesser known.  for this reason it is recomended
to AVOID for profit schools and look for the cheapest recognized accredited insitution. look closely at the accrediation andn look for the SAME as a high cost school
and not a face made up accredition.  in the case of a community college - the most important thing is that the credits transfer.  do your homework and know they will transfer,
to where, and how many you can transfer to map our the cheapest (high quality) education possible. This can be alot of work to map out, almost like you need a college
degree to figure it all out, and  you will figure it out when you are through the process, but if you focus on this aspect up front and learn it before you FINISH the degree
you will save signficant money, putting you potentiallly 5-10 years ahead of the curve in earning potential as you can greatly reduce or avoid debt.

<hr class="inner-row">   <br>   
<h3>For Profit Schools</h3><br>
For Profit schools should be avoided as they are literally created and exist to take your money.  In many cases the accredidatoin (certifiation) will NOT be recognized
by other schools (institutios) not because they can't read the accrediation, but because it is such a joke it does not count. examples of for profit that you should NOT go to are:
<br>
see the list at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_for-profit_universities_and_colleges  and note the number that have CLOSED.<br><br>

<h3>Accreditations</h3><br>
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recognized_higher_education_accreditation_organizations<br>
check it out - if it aint recognized, don't screw with it. USDE and CHEA oversees and recognizes many accrediations including Engineering (ABET), Business (ACBPS), Law (ABA),
Dental (ADA), Pharmacy, (ACPE), Aviation (AABI), etc.   <br>

<h3>Affordable community college</h3><br>
look in your state! in many cases credits a year of school can cost $3k instead of $9k it would at a 4 year school! get your first 2 years done at a community college
and you save (9-3)=6k per year, 2x6k = $12,000! Now that is a good deal.
