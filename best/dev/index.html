<h3>Development History</h3>
Since before the age of computers it has been important to have a process, and work the checklist.  Different systems assign unique owners and influences, but in the end - the work only gets done when someone does it.  Assign as much hierarchy and delegation as you'd like - some smo has to do the work.  Think pyramids,  truly dedicated workers heavly motivated and committed proud of their craft often trump the best carrot-and-stick middle managers. <Br><br>
<h3>Software Development</h3>
Enter the world of complex system and sofware development.  Even the niagra-falls of waterfall analaysis comes with a cost.<Br>
Look for reinforcement of the pyramid convept in the early Crause and Serious car racing movie - a green triangle describing Cheep, Fast, Good.  Pick two.  This classic pyramid fails to address technical debt.  Implying with enough money you can have all good things fast.  Review NASA and their early efforts to put all code modules on 1 page each for easier human review and system simplification and THEN duplicate major systems for redundancy.  I'd argue they had enough money, but barely mad their goals before 1970.  Therefore, truly good systems take time and simplification, something more resources and slappier whips fail to address; architecture.
<br><br>
As truly great leaders have uttered 'if it were not for the last minute, nothing would get done'.  deadlines help system engineers focus and cut through the fat blob of market share and feature creep.  Don't want for those around you to simplify your systems or impose deadlines.  Ask how to simplify, call fewer meetings, find fewer teammate, and push to production sooner then later.
<br><br>
Many great systems have stumbled into their identity through simplficatoin; look at dropbox's early hand drawn icons (that saved soem time), or google voice's human uttered tones.  These engineers knew where to spend their resources and suceeded in reducing technical debt by focusing on the truly hard things, not the shiney.<br/><br>


<hr class="inner-row">   <br>   
<h3>Inner Domain Development</h3><br>
Average Sofware, Dev, Ops, Physical and Robotic Engineering, and Machine learning share a common thread - point a finger.  Always direct focus outside of you domain and team for blame while retaining the credit for any advancements for yourself.  I think Henry Ford did it best as he pesued not an average system, but an Excellent system by focusing not on blame, credit, carrot, stick or stock - but success.  Sucess in setting a valuable and marketing changinig product aside and consciously choosing NOT to lipstick the pig.  How many colors did he offer?  One.  Was this becasuee paint advancements did not warrent acceptable adheasion of the day?  Likely.  Was he smart enough to know that and decide to no make something of lesser value by beign all things to all customers?  Absolutely.  Grab your history books, they are about to repeat themselves.<br/><br>
Skip from the market crash of the developed market in 1929 to the FANG stocks of the recent market surge. Beyone mental mind-share of the market, ask what industries are truly changing systems around you.  Do you want a tastier product faster with less investment on your Part?  Do we have an app for that?  Do you need any of that?  
<br><br>
<h3>Development Deflection</h3><br>
The preceeding mental exercise of sytem simplification results in deflection for truly inferrior teams. If you can't beat them, join them.  Join them at the bottom of blame and your 5 year plan.  Techniques you'll observe in the wild of such teams includes ; numerious meetings where little is accnowledged or accomplished.  Time consuming review processing to focus on stratifying the landscape of whom did more, or deserves more.  A focus on being busy as more important then doing something correctly, or in a mannor that can be extended.  Seeking vendor lock-in as a mechanic for passing the buck.
