<h3>Development History</h3>
Since before the age of computers it has been important to have a process, and work the checklist.  Different systems assign unique owners and influences, but in the end - the work only gets done when someone does it.  Assign as much hierarchy and delegation as you'd like - some smo has to do the work.  Think pyramids,  truly dedicated workers heavily motivated and committed proud of their craft often trump the best carrot-and-stick middle managers. <Br><br>
<h3>Software Development</h3>
Enter the world of complex system and software development.  Even the Niagara-falls of waterfall analysis comes with a cost.<Br>
Look for reinforcement of the pyramid concept in the early Crast and Serious car racing movie - a green triangle describing Cheep, Fast, Good.  Pick two.  This classic pyramid fails to address technical debt.  Implying with enough money you can have all good things fast.  Review NASA and their early efforts to put all code modules on 1 page each for easier human review and system simplification and THEN duplicate major systems for redundancy.  I'd argue they had enough money, but barely mad their goals before 1970.  Therefore, truly good systems take time and simplification, something more resources and sappier whips fail to address; architecture.
<br><br>
As truly great leaders have uttered 'if it were not for the last minute, nothing would get done'.  deadlines help system engineers focus and cut through the fat blob of market share and feature creep.  Don't want for those around you to simplify your systems or impose deadlines.  Ask how to simplify, call fewer meetings, find fewer teammate, and push to production sooner then later.
<br><br>
Many great systems have stumbled into their identity through simplification; look at dropbox's early hand drawn icons (that saved some time), or google voice's human uttered tones.  These engineers knew where to spend their resources and succeeded in reducing technical debt by focusing on the truly hard things, not the shiny.<br/><br>


<hr class="inner-row">   <br>   
<h3>Inner Domain Development</h3><br>
Average Sofware, Dev, Ops, Physical and Robotic Engineering, and Machine learning share a common thread - point a finger.  Always direct focus outside of you domain and team for blame while retaining the credit for any advancements for yourself.  I think Henry Ford did it best as he pursued not an average system, but an Excellent system by focusing not on blame, credit, carrot, stick or stock - but success.  Success in setting a valuable and marketing changing product aside and consciously choosing NOT to lipstick the pig.  How many colours did he offer?  One.  Was this because paint advancements did not warrant acceptable adhesion of the day?  Likely.  Was he smart enough to know that and decide to not make something of lesser value by being all things to all customers?  Absolutely.  Grab your history books, they are about to repeat themselves.<br/><br>
Skip from the market crash of the developed market in 1929 to the FANG stocks of the recent market surge. Beyond mental mind-share of the market, ask what industries are truly changing systems around you.  Do you want a tastier product faster with less investment on your Part?  Do we have an app for that?  Do you need any of that?  
<br><br>
<h3>Development Deflection</h3><br>
The proceeding mental exercise of system simplification results in deflection for truly inferior teams. If you can't beat them, join them.  Join them at the bottom of blame and your 5 year plan.  Techniques you'll observe in the wild of such teams includes; numerous meetings where little is acknowledged or accomplished.  Time consuming review processing to focus on stratifying the landscape of whom did more, or deserves more.  A focus on being busy as more important then doing something correctly, or in a manner that can be extended.  Seeking vendor lock-in as a mechanic for passing the buck.
<br><br>
<h3>Development Market Correction</h3><br>
Whether your are just starting a new system, or extending an existing one, it is important to identify the scope of what success would constitute.  Often in complex systems this can only be determined by slight head-nod of the executives when they see what they like.  In other more open methodologies, exhausting ever combination and gant-charting and feature value weighting the snot out of the system will suffice.  It's important to identify no only where you are now, but how previous systems within your domain have been gauged to be successful.  Likely you'll find the truly successful systems have divined this status by outlasting the competitors in a landscape of not being more fit, but more robust.  Or as I like to find, too simple to failure.  Those are hard to find, and even more difficult to improve upon.  Many landscapes seek hearts and minds (often by offering a discount to the early adopter under the pretext of their evangelism).  This failed to address the fit-for-consumptions of even a most basic sniff test by an intended audience.  The vacuum of higher education often leaves the air so thin that architects know more then their end users, and engineer a proper solution to a mos-identified problem.  The market corrects these positions by seeking the next shiny solution with a failure to analyze their costs.  Take for example the recent washed-up whale on an Oregon (usa) beach that when identified as a community nuisance, was voted to be exploded after the local water fowl were observed pecking at it.  Post explosion, the real work was still left to be done and the market demanded to push the carcass into the ocean.  Don't be the next team that invests in an explosion to be left to do the original work post party-time.
