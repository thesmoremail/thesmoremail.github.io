<h3>SPAM, Phishing, and Spoofing: Identification</h3>
<img style="float:left;margin-right:20px;" src="/img/freecash.jpg"> SmoreMail has been in the unique position of verified spam tools and techniques against the many email available. It is out of this sesspool of oportunity that our observations have been honed to save you the headache of processing unwanted email inefficiently, or ineffectively.  <br/><br/>A failure to identify spam often results in lost productivity and minor increasted system load - but a failure to identify phishing and spoofing can land your accounts payable with a deficit they'd rather avoid. Save face, cash, time and resournces with the following process!<br/><br/>
<ol>
<li>train your systems, train your users - and protect your users from unwanted email! That is what sMoreMail is all about. Of course if you have no system to train because you don't have
     access to the underlying engine - then you need to take personal action. Proceed to step 2.<br><br></li>

<li>Take a look at that email, does it look like super spammy junk? Don't just delete it, right click if ona client, or mark as spam with your client.  This action helps
     train the underlying engine your network professionals have configured.  you may not have direct access to the engine, but this is how you as a user can help your poor pasty skinned IT folks
     who have yet to see the light of day, hate sunlight, and have a lid for their cubicle on order from amazon. look closely, they have ear plugs UNDER their chainsaw sound proofing ear muffs, and those
     new glasses arn't beause they are going blind, it's because they look at LCD's so much they purchased yellow tint glasses to knock down the glare.  even though they work in IT, they are still
     subject to the pitiful IT budget that corporate has allowed and the monitor they are using is actually the one you threw away before upgrading to the new 30" as IT doesn't have a fraction
     of the budget your pitiful department has.  next time leave the monitor without coffee splashes and finger prints. we appreciate that.  <br><br></li>

<li>If the email does not look like obvious spam or phising, don't do anything with it just yet.  put on your Sherlock holmes hat and ask yourself, does this email even make sense? why
     are you now getting an email about accounts payable when you don't work in accounts payable? don't just start clicking things... stop and think.. hmm......  <br><br></li>

<li>at this point you probably already screwed up.   you opened the email didn't you! bugger.... if your email client is not configured right you might already be executing malicious content.
     don't even open the email unless you think it is good! the reason is some lame computer systems will start executing things and that can be really bad for both your files, your computer,
     the copmpanies network, and eventualy accounts payable that should be paying YOUR exepense report and not the foreign script kiddies that just social engineered your network by looking 
     for the lowest common idion (HOPEFULLY NOT YOU) to click random things.  <br><br></li>

<li>now, if safe, open that email. if not safe, shift+delete that thing. bypass the trash box and send it straight to haitees.  don't make the mistake of looking through your archive that you
     decided to save for 'just in case blackmail' and clicking that bugger again.  <br><br></li>

<li>You've opened that email, scrutinized it with a your high level intelect your employeer paid you to use and it looks fishy.  how do you know it's fishy or as we call it here, 'Toasy'  <br><br></li>

<li><h3>Toasty : spelling</h3>  if the spelling is slightly better than sMoreMail then you have a problem.  most professionals use proper capitalization, spelling and only make minor mistakes.
     if this email is not professional, then you have a problem. proceed wiht extreme caution, if in doubt, fall back to old faithful shift+delete.  <br><br></li>

<li><h3>Toasty: 'Hey I know that company'</h3> no you don't - someone just used a template from a well known company and prayed on some stupid marketing scheme.  no better way to get you to
     lower your defenses than to look common. if this is 'form microsoft' or your 'credit card company' or worse a bank, or maybe a client YOU WISH YOU HAD then that is highly unlikely and you
     are about to get punked and be that stupid person that takes down the network or loses funds or your coworkers identiy to an internet shmo.  <br><br></li>

<li><h3>Toasty: 'Click to Download'</h3> marketers want picture perfect and don't want plain text, so it trains dumb users to just start clicking everyhting and downloading, clicking 'ok' and 'yes'
     to every box that pops up as it is the only way to proceed and get your job done - well in this case, you arn't getting anything done, your being punked. if a marketer is not smart enough
     to make basic conent viewable without download then they don't need your patrionage - go strate to shift+delete. as you start clicking yes to everythign just so you can even view the Email-
     there is a good chance you are clicking 'yes' to give permission to execution, as in YOUR EXECUTION,  not just the running of a random file on your computer and network. when you see 'execute'
     think you.. you are about to get executed, by your coworkers, boss and team mates that will look for the rope and pitch forks when you take down the network. <br><br></li>

<li> <h3>Toasty: links</h3> if you have made it this far, still consider shift+delete to nuke this turd.  you probably are still dealing with a live one, a super bad email.  look at all those hyperlinks
     that email - notice when you hover over, even that 'unsubscribe' the computer shows you where the link WILL GO.  see all that random giberish or root name that is NOT who you thought it was? well
     that is because this link will send you to a tracking wesite, or worse, one that serves malicious content. when you hover over and look at that link with that trained professional sMoreMail trained
     eye you now have the power of grayskull to know shift+delete is the answer. this spam is a turd, flush it.<br><br></li>

<li><h3>Toasty: attachments</h3> look close at those stupid attachments.  flufy kitty not from smoremail.jpg.EXE is not a real file. that ending is not a real image. learn about computers,
     learn about the types of attachments you are expecting and don't run stupid stuff. anthing that needs to be run is a super red flag, like flush the turd red flag.  this includes pretty much
     any microsfot attachment that has VBA inside (used to run scripts), computer executables, self extracting anything, even zip files are containers for executables.  now it gets interesting,
     someone can serve you a PDF that you say 'hey, no bad junk in there, no execuables!'. WOW, just got punked again.  you open that pDF and start clicking random hyperlinks. yup.  your a smo,
     or a shmore, your coworkers will let you konw when the damage is done.  <br><br></li>

<li><h3>Fishy: </h3><br><br></li>
