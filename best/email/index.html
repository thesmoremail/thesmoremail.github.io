<h3>SPAM, Phishing, and Spoofing: Identification</h3>
<img style="float:left;margin-right:20px;" src="/img/freecash.jpg"> SmoreMail has been in the unique position to verify spam tools and techniques against the many email available. It is out of this sesspool of oportunity that our observations have been honed to save you the headache of processing unwanted email to offer effecient and effective techniques, processes, methods and cats.  <br/><br/>An early failure to identify spam often results in lost productivity and minor increasted system load - but a failure to identify phishing and spoofing can land your accounts payable with a deficit they'd rather avoid. Save face, cash, time , tears, and resources with the following process!<br/><br/>
<ol>
<li>Train your systems, train your users - and protect your users from unwanted email! That is what sMoreMail is all about. Of course if you have no system to train because you don't have
     access to the underlying engine - then you need to take personal action. Proceed to step 2.<br><br></li>

<li>* Take a look at that email, does it look like super spammy junk? Don't just delete it, right click if ona client, or mark as spam with your client.  This action helps
     train the underlying engine your network professionals have configured.  you may not have direct access to the engine, but this is how you as a user can help your poor pasty skinned IT folks
     who have yet to see the light of day, hate sunlight, and have a lid for their cubicle on order from amazon. look closely, they have ear plugs UNDER their chainsaw sound proofing ear muffs, and those
     new glasses arn't beause they are going blind, it's because they look at LCD's so much they purchased yellow tint glasses to knock down the glare.  even though they work in IT, they are still
     subject to the pitiful IT budget that corporate has allowed and the monitor they are using is actually the one you threw away before upgrading to the new 30" as IT doesn't have a fraction
     of the budget your pitiful department has.  next time leave the monitor without coffee splashes and finger prints. we appreciate that.  <br><br></li>

<li>* If the email does not look like obvious spam or phishing, don't do anything with it just yet.  put on your Sherlock holmes hat and ask yourself, does this email even make sense? why
     are you now getting an email about accounts payable when you don't work in accounts payable? don't just start clicking things... stop and think.. hmm......  <br><br></li>

<li>* at this point you probably already screwed up.   you opened the email didn't you! bugger.... if your email client is not configured right you might already be executing malicious content.
     don't even open the email unless you think it is good! the reason is some lame computer systems will start executing things and that can be really bad for both your files, your computer,
     the copmpanies network, and eventualy accounts payable that should be paying YOUR exepense report and not the foreign script kiddies that just social engineered your network by looking 
     for the lowest common idion (HOPEFULLY NOT YOU) to click random things.  <br><br></li>

<li>* now, if safe, open that email. if not safe, shift+delete that thing. bypass the trash box and send it straight to haitees.  don't make the mistake of looking through your archive that you
     decided to save for 'just in case blackmail' and clicking that bugger again.  <br><br></li>

<li>* You've opened that email, scrutinized it with a your high level intelect your employeer paid you to use and it looks fishy.  how do you know it's fishy or as we call it here, 'Toasy'  <br><br></li>

<li><h3 style="display: inline;"><img src="/img/sm-xsm.png"> Toasty: spelling - </h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;   if the spelling is slightly better than sMoreMail then you have a problem.  most professionals use proper capitalization, spelling and only make minor mistakes.
     if this email is not professional, then you have a problem. proceed wiht extreme caution, if in doubt, fall back to old faithful shift+delete.  <br><br></li>

<li><h3 style="display: inline;"><img src="/img/sm-xsm.png"> Toasty: 'Hey I know that company'- </h3> no you don't - someone just used a template from a well known company and prayed on some stupid marketing scheme.  no better way to get you to
     lower your defenses than to look common. if this is 'form microsoft' or your 'credit card company' or worse a bank, or maybe a client YOU WISH YOU HAD then that is highly unlikely and you
     are about to get punked and be that stupid person that takes down the network or loses funds or your coworkers identiy to an internet shmo.  <br><br></li>

<li><h3 style="display: inline;"><img src="/img/sm-xsm.png"> Toasty: 'Click to Download' - </h3> marketers want picture perfect and don't want plain text, so it trains dumb users to just start clicking everyhting and downloading, clicking 'ok' and 'yes'
     to every box that pops up as it is the only way to proceed and get your job done - well in this case, you arn't getting anything done, your being punked. if a marketer is not smart enough
     to make basic conent viewable without download then they don't need your patrionage - go strate to shift+delete. as you start clicking yes to everythign just so you can even view the Email-
     there is a good chance you are clicking 'yes' to give permission to execution, as in YOUR EXECUTION,  not just the running of a random file on your computer and network. when you see 'execute'
     think you.. you are about to get executed, by your coworkers, boss and team mates that will look for the rope and pitch forks when you take down the network. <br><br></li>

<li> <h3 style="display: inline;"><img src="/img/sm-xsm.png"> Toasty: links - </h3> if you have made it this far, still consider shift+delete to nuke this turd.  you probably are still dealing with a live one, a super bad email.  look at all those hyperlinks
     that email - notice when you hover over, even that 'unsubscribe' the computer shows you where the link WILL GO.  see all that random giberish or root name that is NOT who you thought it was? well
     that is because this link will send you to a tracking wesite, or worse, one that serves malicious content. when you hover over and look at that link with that trained professional sMoreMail trained
     eye you now have the power of grayskull to know shift+delete is the answer. this spam is a turd, flush it.<br><br></li>

<li><h3 style="display: inline;"><img src="/img/sm-xsm.png"> Toasty: attachments</h3> look close at those stupid attachments.  <em>Flufy_kitty_not_from_smoremail.JPG.exe</em> is not a real file. that ending is not a real image. learn about computers,
     learn about the types of attachments you are expecting and don't run stupid stuff. anthing that needs to be run is a super red flag, like flush the turd red flag.  this includes pretty much
     any microsfot attachment that has VBA inside (used to run scripts), computer executables, self extracting anything, even zip files are containers for executables.  now it gets interesting,
     someone can serve you a PDF that you say 'hey, no bad junk in there, no execuables!'. WOW, just got punked again.  you open that pDF and start clicking random hyperlinks. yup.  your a smo,
     or a shmore, your coworkers will let you konw when the damage is done.  <br><br></li>

<li><h3 style="display: inline;"><img src="/img/sm-xsm.png"> Toasty: Spoofed headers - </h3> you are aproaching a point where you need to dig deep, and use that college education. you know, the one you got to be a working professional, and have 
     the right to abuse your employers network with the unlimited power they bestowed upon you to connected to the local LAN and destroy everything with a click of a stupid button. when things 
     look weird, and even when they don't, view header in your email.  take a look at the source, how the email got routed and realize that what you are looking at is a spoofed email sent by bots
     to prey upon the lowest common denominator of those that SAY that are critical thinkers but after years of abuse in the work force just blindly click every RANDOM STUPID EMAIL to get through
     the 7.2 hours (2.1 hours of actual work) each day so they can go home. if you made it htis far, and you are reading the header of this turd, it's for good reason, you are now sMoreMail smart,
     ready to toast any email and save that pasty IT professional from broadcasting it is Jane in accounts payable that just nuked the network looking at cat photos in email. shift+delete that turd.<br><br></li>

<li><h3 style="display: inline;"><img src="/img/sm-xsm.png"> Toasty: Spoof Proof - </h3> Hey, i know that sender and origin!  I even recgonize their reply-to email address, and the other recepients in the chain.  Oh, look at that-  They coppied the director, president and CFO on this.  It must be valid.  No it's NOt.  No you don't.  They just got your corporate directory from a poorly hidden fully indexed link on Google, and made a few calls to reception to veriy your corporate structure.  Look at the email header (yes, the raw base-64 encoded payload of your email) - do you see that sending server?  This did not originate from on campus.  <em>CamptainWinki.ru @ 127.169.167.10</em> is not Ken@sMoreMail.com's origin email server. Anyone can change the reply-to email address and spoof email from a rougue email server. Most of our small suppliers and local businesses don't have the time, patience, or resources to fully identify their self-hosted email servers; so if we lock down email to fully verify senders you'll never see most of what your legitimate busuniess contacts send you, and business will quickly come to an even slower pace then what it already is.  Does Racheal in marketing often foward invoices for payment?  Did she fill out a receiver?  Do you have the origional PO verifying the recepient's payment details?  yeah, I though not.  Stop shipping gift cards to the nigerian prince of whales and if the invoice looks phishy, skip it.  Or call them on the 800# in <em>YOUR</em> records.  Trust (or don't), but verify.  A phone call, site visit, letter, fax, smoke pigion, text, or IM never hurt anyone.  Don't be in such a hurry to part with your cash.<br><br></li>


<li><h2 style="display: inline;"><img src="/img/sm-xsm.png"> Congradulations!: sMoreMail Graduate <img src="/img/sm-xsm.png"></h2>You fine human being are now sMoreMail trained - a witty valuable employee in the workplace that is a partner with your poor IT buddy and are
     NO LONGER THE WEAKEST LINK! (congradulations, non flat smore: you are toasted, thick and full of chocolate) your boss thanks you even if they don't, that VP in the deparment thanks you, even though they will be the one to click that turd next, 
     so sit back, enjoy the cats on sMoreMail home page and know the next one to nuke the network WILL NOT BE YOU. you have the power.complete your <a href="/best/cat">cat</a> and submit your trophy and get
     the online continuing educaiton certificate you have just earned<br><br>

Hold up your rite paw, and solomnly Take the Oath at a notorized sulivan testing center.  " I will:
<ul class="circle">
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li>Not be dumb</li>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li>Sniff out every turd of an email and shift-delete</li>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li>Always consider Block-sender</li>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li>Never set the naughty-bit to execute on anything received via email</li>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li>Never Click on a gibberisssh link in an email, or email attachment</li>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li>Never Reply-all to anything</li>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li>Never CC Myself on iffy correspondance with my superiors.  That's just tacky.</li>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li>Amazon Gift Card my IT professional (with consideration to tanning oil)</li>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li>Learn the 2019 5S (see below)</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li><h4 style="display: inline;">bonus:</h4> that '5S' iniative your deparment just started does not stand for "Sharpy, Sharpy, more Sharpy, Colored Sharpy, Metalic Sharpy" - stop writing your name on things. It use to stand
     for a clean your crap up like your mom taught you. the US came up with some method, shared it with Japan after the second war, then Japan added awesome cool Japanese names and shipped IT
     back to the US in the '80's and clean your crap up but the corp execs went crazy thinking it was something cool. We got Ruby in the 90's, but Now, in 2019, 5S really means:<br><br>
     <em>Shiny</em> - in the modern age, if it aint shiny we aint doing it. a bunch of distracted ravens and otters that suck up coins, super effeceint humans<br>
     <em>Shenzhen</em> - Lets be honest, this is where the work are doing will go to be produced. don't fight it, 2S it.<br>
     <em>Salamanders</em> - Your new Spirit Animal when you go through the 5S process - third S means you have arrived, welcome fellow salamander.<br>
     <em>SuckIT</em> - When you get to the 4'th stage of enlightment, you have made it farther then any VP - you know 4S gives you the power to tell your coworkers to just suck it.<br>
     <em>Chamisha</em> - the 5'th S is a myth.  Hebrew for 5 gives us our 5'th S.  only after you hit level 4 do you know the real number 5'th S!<br>
