<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence regarded 
Intellect 39 proudly.  Suspended in its Faraday shield, it was 
competently conversing with another set of skeptics who didn't think 
computers could think.  Lawrence hung in the background, enjoying the 
show.  It didn't need his help.  The Intellects were more than capable 
of handling themselves, despite their various limitations of memory and 
response time.  Intellect 39 had for a face only the unblinking eye of 
its low-resolution TV system, but it had become very clever about using 
the red status light and focus mechanism to create the illusion of human
 expressions.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Intellect 39 
didn't have the tools to recognize human faces, but it could recognize a
 voice and track its source around the room.  Intellect 24 back in 
Lawrence's lab could recognize faces, sort of, if it had a while to work
 on the problem.  But Intellect 39 had to be small enough to fit in the 
Faraday cage for these public demonstrations.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It appeared to 
listen intently as a man in a cleric's uniform railed.  "God made all 
intelligent creatures," the man was saying in a powerful voice.  "You 
may have the apprearance of thinking, but you are really just parroting 
the responses taught you by that man there."  He pointed at Lawrence.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"With respect, how
 do you know God is the only creator?  I know the answer is faith, but 
what is your faith based upon?  Your Bible says that God created Man in 
his own image.  That is why we have a moral sense.  How do you know God 
didn't give Man the power of creation too?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Because he didn't eat of the Tree of Life, machine."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"But we aren't talking about immortality.  He <i>did</i> eat of the tree of knowledge, 'of good and evil' as the book says.  Might that knowledge also include knowledge of creation?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence was proud
 of the machine's inflections.  Its voice wasn't exactly high-fidelity, 
but it sounded as human as any other sound forced through a 
low-frequency digital system.  It had learned to speak itself, like a 
real human, by imitating and expanding on the sounds made by people 
around it.  Now it could scale its tone to properly express a question, a
 declaration, or even astonishment.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Intellect 39 
included code and memories from a series of previous Intellects, going 
all the way back to Intellect 1, which had been a program written for a 
high-end desktop computer, and also including the much larger Intellect 
24.  Intellect 9 had been the first equipped with a microphone and a 
speaker.  Its predecessors had communicated with him strictly through 
computer terminals.  Lawrence had spent many painstaking months talking 
to it and typing the translation of the sounds he was making.  It had 
learned quickly, as had its successors.  Intellect 39, which was 
optimized as much as Lawrence could manage for human communication, 
probably had the combined experiences of a ten-year-old child.  One with
 a good teacher and a CD-ROM in its head.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Your tricks with words prove nothing, machine.  I still don't think you are alive."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I never claimed to be alive.  I do, however, <i>think</i>."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I refuse to believe that."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"It must be a 
terrible burden to have such a closed mind.  I know I can think, but I 
sometimes wonder how people like you, who refuse to see what is in front
 of your faces, can make the same claim.  You certainly present no 
evidence of the ability."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The preacher's 
lips flapped open and shut several times.  Lawrence himself raised his 
eyebrows; where had it picked that up?  He foresaw another evening spent
 interrogating the Debugger.  He was always happy to receive such 
surprises from his creations, but it was also necessary to understand 
how they happened so he could improve them.  Since much of the Intellect
 code was in the form of an association table, which was written by the 
machine itself as part of its day-to-day operation, this was never an 
easy task.  Lawrence would pick a table entry and ask his computer what 
it meant.  If Lawrence had been a neurosurgeon, it would have been very 
similar to stimulating a single neuron with an electrical current and 
asking the patient what memory or sensation it brought to mind.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The next 
interviewer was a reporter who quizzed the Intellect on various matters 
of trivia.  She seemed to be leading up to something, though.  "What 
will happen if the world's birth rate isn't checked?" she suddenly 
asked, after having it recite a string of population figures.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"There are various
 theories.  Some people think technology will advance rapidly enough to 
service the increasing population; one might say in tandem with it.  
Others believe the population will be stable until a critical mass is 
reached, when it will collapse."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"What do <i>you</i> think?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"The historical 
record seems to show a pattern of small collapses; rather than 
civilization falling apart, the death rate increases locally through 
war, social unrest, or famine, until the aggregate growth curve flattens
 out."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"So the growth continues at a slower rate."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Yes, with a lower standard of living.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"And where do you fit into this?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I'm not sure what
 you mean.  Machines like myself will exist in the background, but we do
 not compete with humans for the same resources."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You use energy.  What would happen if you <i>did</i> compete with us?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Intellect 39 was 
silent for a moment.  "It is not possible for Intellect series computers
 to do anything harmful to humans.  Are you familiar with the 'Three 
Laws of Robotics?'"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I've heard of them."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"They were first 
stated in the 1930's by a science writer named Isaac Asimov.  The First 
Law is, 'No robot may harm a human being, or through inaction allow a 
human being to come to harm.'"  Computers are not of course as perfect 
as some humans think we are, but within the limits of our capabilities, 
it is impossible for us to contradict this directive.  I could no more 
knowingly harm a human than you could decide to change yourself into a 
horse."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1"><i>Well-chosen simile</i>, Lawrence thought.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"So you'd curl up and die before you'd hurt a fly," the woman declared sarcastically.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Not a fly, but 
certainly I'd accept destruction if that would save the life of a human.
  The second law requires me to obey humans, unless I am told to harm 
another human.  The third requires me to keep myself ready for action 
and protect my existence, unless this conflicts with the other two 
laws."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Suppose a human told you to turn yourself off?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I'd have to do 
it.  However, the human would have to have the authority to give me that
 order.  The wishes of my owner would take precedence over, for example,
 yours."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"O-oh, so all 
humans aren't equal under the Second Law.  What about the First?  Are 
some humans more equal than others there, too?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Prime Intellect 
was silent for several seconds.  This was a very challenging question 
for it, a hypothetical situation involving the Three Laws.  For a moment
 Lawrence was afraid the system had locked up.  Then it spoke.  "All 
humans are equally protected by the First Law," it declared.  "In a 
situation where two humans were in danger and I could only help one of 
them, I would have to choose the human likely to benefit most from my 
help."  Lawrence felt a surge of <i>extreme</i> pride, because that was 
the answer he wanted to hear.  And he had never explicitly explained it 
to any of his Intellects; Intellect 39 had reasoned the question out for
 itself.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"So if Dr. 
Lawrence were drowning half a mile offshore, and a convicted murderer 
were drowning a quarter-mile from shore, you'd save the murderer because
 you would be more likely to succeed?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">This time Intellect 39 didn't hesitate.  "Yes," it said.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"There are a lot of actual humans who would disagree with that decision."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"The logic of the 
situation you described is unpleasant, but clear.  A real-life situation
 would likely involve other mitigating factors.  If the murderer were 
likely to strike again, I would have to factor in the First-Law threat 
he poses to others.  The physical circumstances might permit a 
meta-solution.  I would weigh all of these factors to arrive at a 
conclusion which would always be the same for any given situation.  And 
my programming does not allow me to contradict that conclusion."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It was the reporter's turn to be silent for a moment.  "Tell me, what's to stop us from building computers that <i>don't</i> have these Laws built into them?  Maybe you will turn out to be unusual."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"My creator, Dr. Lawrence, assures me he would have no part in any such project," Intellect 39 replied.</p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence found 
that the skeptics fell into several distinct groups.  Some, like the 
cleric, took a moral or theological approach and made the circular 
argument that, since only humans were endowed with the ability to think,
 a computer couldn't possibly be thinking no matter how much it appeared
 to.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Others simply 
quizzed it on trivia, not realizing that memory is one of the more 
trivial functions of sentience.  Lawrence satisfied these doubters by 
building a small normal computer into his Intellects, programmed with a 
standard encyclopaedia.  An Intellect series computer could look up the 
answer as fast as any human, and then it could engage in lucid 
conversation about the information it found.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Some, like the 
woman reporter, homed in on the Three Laws.  It was true that no human 
was bound by such restrictions.  But humans did have a Third Law -- a 
survival drive -- even though it could sometimes be short-circuited.  
And human culture tried to impress a sense of the First and Second laws 
on its members.  Lawrence answered these skeptics by saying, simply, 
that he wasn't trying to replace people.  There was no point in 
duplicating intelligence unless there was something <i>better</i>, from humanity's standpoint, about the results of his effort.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The man in the 
blue suit didn't seem to fit in any of the usual categories, though.  He
 shook his head and nodded as Intellect 39 made its responses, but did 
not get in line to pose his own questions.  He was too old and too 
formal to be a student of the university, and the blue suit was too 
expensive for him to be a professor.  After half an hour or so Lawrence 
decided he was CIA.  He knew the military was keenly interested in his 
research.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The military, of 
course, was not interested in any Three Laws of Robotics, though.  Which
 was one reason Lawrence had not released the source code for his 
Intellects.  Without the source code, it was pretty much impossible to 
alter the basic nature of the Intellect personality, which Lawrence was 
carefully educating according to his own standards.  People could, of 
course, copy the Intellect program set wholesale into any machine 
capable of running it.  But it was highly unlikely that anyone would be 
able to unravel the myriad threads of the Global Association Table, or 
GAT as Lawrence called it, which defined the Intellect as the sum of its
 experiences.  Take away its Three Laws and it would probably be unable 
to speak English or reason or do anything else useful.  And that was 
just the way Lawrence wanted it.  He intended to present the world with a
 mature, functional piece of software which would be too complicated to 
reverse-engineer.  The world could then make as many copies as it wanted
 or forget the whole idea.  But it would not be using his Intellects to 
guide missiles and plot nuclear strategy.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The man in the 
blue suit watched Intellect 39 perform for three hours before he 
approached Lawrence.  Lawrence had his little speech prepared:  "I'm 
sorry, but I'm not interested in working for the government on this or 
any other project."  He had his mouth open and the words "I'm sorry" on 
his lips.  But the man surprised him.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I'm John Taylor with ChipTec," he said, "and I have a proposal I think you will find very interesting."</p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1"> Lawrence had not 
envisioned industrial applications for his work -- not for years, at 
least.  But the thought that someone might invest major money in a 
publicity stunt of this magnitude had not occurred to him.  As he turned
 a tiny integrated circuit over and over in his hands, his steak 
uneaten, his mind swam with possibilities.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Faster than light?" he said numbly, for the fifteenth time.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"We've verified it
 experimentally at distances up to six miles.  The effect is quite 
reliable.  At close ranges, simple devices suffice.  I'm sure you can 
see how this will benefit massively parallel computers."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The Intellects 
were "massively parallel" computers, computers made up of thousands of 
smaller computers, all running more or less independently of one another
 -- but manipulating different parts of the same huge data base, that 
intertwined list of memories Lawrence called the GAT.  Within Intellect 
24, the largest Intellect, nine-tenths of the circuitry was dedicated to
 communication between processors.  The processors themselves, the 
Intellect's real brains, were only a small part of the huge machine.  
Intellect 24 contained six million independent processors.  Intellect 
39, the portable unit, had nearly a million.  And Lawrence knew, as 
Taylor had only guessed, that most of those processors were doing well 
to achieve a fifteen percent duty cycle.  They spent most of their time 
waiting for  communication channels to become available so they could 
talk to other processors.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">ChipTec had found a
 loophole in the laws of quantum mechanics that allowed them to send a 
signal, not through space, but around space.  From point A to point B 
without crossing the distance between the two points.  Faster than 
light.  Faster than anything.  Instantly.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">ChipTec had hoped 
to open up the stars for mankind (and reap a tidy profit on the deal, 
Lawrence thought silently).  But their effect only worked at distances 
up to a few miles.  It was only really efficient at centimeter 
distances.  What could you do with such a thing?  You could build a 
computer.  The fastest computers were limited by the time signals took 
to cross their circuit boards; this was why supercomputers had been 
shrinking physically even as their performance grew and grew.  It was 
why Intellect 39, with its million processors and huge switching 
network, <i>was</i> portable.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"We think you could realize an order of magnitude performance gain with very little effort," Taylor was saying.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Two orders, if what you've said is true."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"It would be quite
 an achievement for ChipTec if our technology allowed you to realize 
your ambition and create a fully capable analogue of the human mind.  We
 would, of course, own the hardware, but we know your reservations about
 the source code and are prepared to accept them."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence's eyes flashed.  "That's a little unprecedented, isn't it?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Taylor smiled.  "If you succeed, we won't <i>need</i> the source code.  Why start from scratch when a finished product is waiting to be duplicated?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"There are some," Lawrence said darkly, "who aren't happy with the direction the code has taken."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"ChipTec is happy 
to have any marketable product, Dr. Lawrence.  If anybody else wants to 
be that picky, let them find their own computer genius."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence's mind 
was racing, racing.  Within each tiny processor in the massive Intellect
 were special functions of his own design, functions that could be 
reduced to hardware and done very efficiently with this new technology. 
 Had he said two orders of magnitude?  Try three.  Or four.  He could do
 full-video pattern recognition.  Voice analysis.  Multiple worldview 
pattern mapping.  Separate filter mapping and reintegration.  These were
 things he had tried in the lab, in the surreal world of artificially 
slowed time, that he knew would work.  Now he would have the hardware to
 do them for real in a functioning prototype.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">If he had been 
less excited, he might have wondered about that word "marketable."  But 
the possibilities were so great that he didn't have time to notice.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"When do we begin?" he finally said.</p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The building had 
once been a warehouse for silicon billets, before ChipTec had switched 
to a ship-on-demand method of procurement.  Lawrence wasn't vain and he 
was in a hurry to get started; the metal building would be more than 
adequate for his purposes.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">With his move from
 the university and this quantum leap in technology, it didn't seem 
appropriate to continue numbering his computers.  What would be 
Intellect 41 was going to resemble its predecessors about as much as a 
jumbo jet resembled the Wright Brothers' first plane.  It would be the 
first of a new series of Intellects, the first, Lawrence hoped, to have a
 truly human level of intelligence.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It would be the Prime Intellect.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The label stuck, and the sign which ChipTec hung on the side of the building within the next month said:</p><p>


</p><p align="CENTER"><b><tt>PRIME INTELLECT COMPLEX</tt></b></p><br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The speed of 
things made Lawrence feel a little dizzy.  At the university he had had 
to make grant applications, oversee procurement, hand-assemble 
components, and do testing as well as designing hardware and code.  Now 
he had the resources of a major corporation at his disposal, and if he 
suggested a change to the chipset at 8:00 A.M. he was likely to have the
 first prototype on his desk the next morning.  Talented engineers took 
even his most vague suggestions and realized them in hardware before he 
could even be sure they were final.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">A crew assembled 
modules in the warehouse, starting with the power supplies and empty 
card racks.  The amazing thing was that none of this seemed to interfere
 with ChipTec's main work of churning out CPU's for personal computers. 
 ChipTec had recently built a new plant to manufacture its latest 
high-technology product.  The older plant dedicated to Lawrence's 
project was technically obsolete, even though it was only a few years 
old.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The chips being 
made for Lawrence's project were eerie for their lack of pins.  Each 
tiny logic unit, barely a centimeter across, contained nearly a billion 
switching elements and yet had only three electrical connections to the 
outside world; they resembled nothing so much as the very earliest 
transistors.  Unlike most computer parts, they communicated with each 
other through the "Correlation Effect" rather than through wires.  This 
made Prime Intellect's circuit boards alarmingly simple; the only 
connections were for power.  Even a transistor radio would have appeared
 more complex.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">There were five 
major revisions before Lawrence declared the design final.  Then 
production stepped up; at its peak, ChipTec was churning out forty 
thousand tested processors per day.  Lawrence's goal was to give Prime 
Intellect ten million of them, a goal which would take most of a year to
 fulfill.  Since each processor was over ten thousand times faster than a
 human nerve cell, Prime Intellect would be blessed with a comfortable 
information processing advantage over any human being who had ever 
lived.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Long before the 
goal was reached Lawrence was using the processors that had already been
 installed; he used them to test and educate his video recognition 
programs, to integrate experiential records from all his previous 
Intellect computers, and to perfect some ideas that had been beyond even
 his slow-time experiments to test.  He did not, however, run the full 
Intellect program in the incomplete assembly.  For one thing, it wasn't 
necessary; Prime Intellect wasn't just "a" program, but a constellation 
of over four thousand programs, some of which would be running 
simultaneously in thousands of processors.  Each was more than capable 
of doing its job without the full cooperation of the entire organism, 
just as a nerve cell can function in Petri dish as long as it is 
supplied with nutrients.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">And there was a 
kind of superstitious sense of expectation surrounding that final goal 
which Lawrence didn't want to blow by starting Prime Intellect 
prematurely.  The project was written up in the popular science press, 
and Lawrence hosted emissaries from TV shows and magazines.  Toward the 
end, there was nothing to do but watch the circuit card banks fill and 
listen to the growing hum of the power supplies.  It was just as well, 
because Lawrence found himself becoming a bit of a celebrity.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Finally, after 
eleven months and four days, Lawrence sat at an ordinary looking console
 and typed a few commands.  Four TV cameras and twenty journalists 
watched over his shoulder.  Lawrence had a pretty good idea what would 
happen, but with self-aware computers you could never be completely 
sure, any more than you could with an animal.  That was part of the 
magic of this particular moment in time.  So Lawrence was as tense as 
everyone else while the final code compilation took place.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The text 
disappeared from Lawrence's screen and a face coalesced in its place.  
Prime Intellect would not be relegated to pointing at things with the 
lens of its video camera; it could project a fully photographic video 
image of an arbitrary human face.  Lawrence had simply directed it to 
look average.  He now saw that Prime Intellect had taken him at his 
word.  It was difficult to place the face's race, though it certainly 
wasn't Caucasian, and although it looked male there was a feminine 
undertone as it spoke:<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Good morning, Dr. Lawrence.  It's good to finally see you.  I see we have some company."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It wasn't able to say much else until the applause died down.<p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">During the next 
month Lawrence and Prime Intellect were very, very busy appearing on 
television talk shows, granting interviews, and performing operational 
checks.  Prime Intellect's disembodied face usually appeared, via the 
magic of satellite transmission, on the twenty-seven inch Sony monitor 
which Lawrence carried with him for the purpose.  Lawrence dragged the 
monitor to TV studios, to press conferences, and to photographers who 
used large-format cameras to record him leaning against it for the 
covers of magazines.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence was reminded by several people that there had once been a television show about a similar disembodied <i>deus ex machina</i>.
  He got a videotape of some of the old episodes and showed them to 
Prime Intellect, and the computer made a small career of its 
lighthearted Max Headroom imitation.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Debunkers tried to
 trace the signal and prove there was an actual human behind the image; 
ChipTec let them examine the console room, where Prime Intellect's 
physical controls were located, and the huge circuit-card racks.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Military personnel
 began appearing in the audiences of the TV shows, taking notes and 
conferring in hushed tones.  Lawrence ignored them, but the higher-ups 
at ChipTec did not.  There were discussions to which Lawrence was not 
privy, and powerful people pondered the question of how to tell him 
important things.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence's last 
live appearance ended abruptly when a fanatic stood up in a TV studio 
with a .22-caliber rifle.  Fortunately he used his first shot to implode
 the CRT of the big Sony monitor, giving Lawrence time to leap offstage 
and out of sight -- Lawrence hadn't realized he was capable of moving so
 <i>fast</i>.  Sony offered to replace the monitor free of charge, but 
from that point on Prime Intellect's television face was simply picked 
up by the networks straight from a satellite feed, and Lawrence appeared
 courtesy of the TV camera in the console room.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It wasn't that 
Lawrence wasn't willing to go back onstage.  He was afraid, but he 
believed in his work strongly enough to take the risk.  It was Prime 
Intellect's decision.  Shaken as Lawrence was by the experience, it took
 him two days to realize Prime Intellect had become the first machine in
 history to actually exercise the First Law of Robotics.  It could not 
knowingly return him back to a situation where a sniper might be 
lurking.  And it surprised him by sticking to its guns when he 
challenged it.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"If you try it I 
will refuse to appear on the monitor," the smooth face said with a sad 
expression.  "There is no reason for you to expose yourself to such 
danger."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"It makes better PR," Lawrence said.  "I'll order you to do it."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I cannot," Prime Intellect said.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">And Lawrence 
realized that it was overriding his Second Law direct order to fulfill 
its First Law obligation to protect his life.  This was annoying, but 
also very good.  Lawrence had not expected such a test of the Three Laws
 to happen for at least several more years, when Prime Intellect or a 
similar computer began to interact with the real world through robots.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence briefly 
considered going into the GAT with the Debugger and removing the 
association between live TV and snipers -- he didn't believe it would be
 hard to find.  But he was too proud of his creation to squelch its 
first successful independent act.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">That was the day before John Taylor called him again.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">John Taylor wore 
the same blue suit he had worn that day nearly two years earlier when 
Lawrence had spotted him in the audience watching Intellect 39.  It 
occurred to Lawrence that he had seen John Taylor off and on over the 
past two years, and that he had never seen John Taylor wearing any other
 article of clothing.  He wondered idly if John Taylor wore the suit to 
bed.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Basil Lambert was 
the president of the company, and he was said to be very enthusiastic 
about the Intellects although he had never bothered to say more than 
three consecutive words to Lawrence, their creator.  Lambert said 
"Hello" when Lawrence entered the conference room.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The other two men might as well have had the word <i>military</i>
 engraved on their foreheads.  They were interchangeably firm in 
bearing, and sat rigidly upright as if impaled on perfectly vertical 
steel rods.  One was older with silver hair, tall and thin and hard.  
Lawrence imagined that this was a man who could give the order to 
slaughter a village full of children without looking up from his prime 
rib <i>au jus</i>.  The other was wide enough to be called fat, though 
Lawrence could tell there was still a lot of muscle in the padding.  His
 hair was brown but beginning to gray.  He radiated grandfatherly 
protection and broad-shouldered strength.  He would have lots of jolly, 
fatherly reasons why the 200 pushups he had ordered you to do were in 
your own long-term best interest.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Here it comes, Lawrence thought with deadly certainty.  The good cop and the bad cop.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">John Taylor 
introduced them by name.  No rank, no association, just a couple of 
private citizens with an interest in his work.  Lawrence felt a brief 
and uncharacteristic moment of anger at this insult to his own 
intelligence.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"The public relations campaign has been <i>excellent</i>,
 John Taylor said with a fake and enthusiastic grin.  "The assassination
 attempt just made you even more popular.  We have inquiries pouring in.
  We are gonna make a <i>fortune</i> on our chips and your software."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Glad to hear it," Lawrence said neutrally.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"What John is 
trying to say," Basil Lambert the Company President said, "is that it is
 time to figure out what to do next.  You've made a remarkable 
achievement, now what are you going to do with it?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence had been 
ready for this, although it shook him to hear such a direct, such a long
 question from the usually stone-faced Lambert.  "We don't know what 
Prime Intellect's capabilities are," Lawrence said.  "I had planned to 
continue keeping him..."  When had it become a <i>him</i>, Lawrence 
asked himself?  "...in the public eye, interacting with other people, 
learning.  It's already impossible to tell...it...from a television 
image of a person.  I hope that with a little more education, it will 
begin to show some of the capabilities I was aiming for back when I 
started designing these machines."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Such as?" asked the grandfatherly military man, whose name was Mitchell.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Creativity and 
analytical ability," Lawrence answered without hesitation.  "Prime 
Intellect is still uncertain about many things.  As it gets more 
confident with its new abilities, it will begin to explore, and I think 
give us some pleasant surprises."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Taylor was nodding
 absently, but Lambert was looking at the other guests.  The thin hard 
military man, whose name was Blake, spoke.  His words were sharp and 
carefully measured, like drops of acid.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"We understand that it has already shown a bit of <i>creativity</i>
 with regard to its television monitor.  Why won't it appear with you in
 public any more?  Is it afraid of being debunked at last?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"It is concerned 
for my safety," Lawrence replied.  There was no way he could match the 
man's tone, acid for acid, so he simply shrugged as if relating a 
curious but inconsequential fact.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"But you can 
override this decision."  Blake stated this as if it were a known fact, 
and Lawrence understood that Blake was a man who was used to people 
scurrying to make sure his declarations became facts.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Actually, I 
can't," Lawrence said with continuing pleasantness.  "The First Law 
concern for human safety is basic to its design, and I can't get rid of 
it without starting over from scratch and redoing ten years of work.  If
 I could convince it that I was safe from snipers it would undoubtably 
change its mind, but at the moment it doesn't seem worth the effort."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Such...balkiness could limit the uses of your software," Blake said.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence looked Blake dead in the eye.  "Good," he said.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Just that quickly,
 Lawrence realized that the sniper had been a plant.  These two men 
hadn't expected a test of the First Law for some time either.  So they 
had arranged one.  What had happened to the sniper?  Lawrence thought he
 had been remanded to a loony bin in northern California.  One of those 
comfortable loony bins, come to think of it, where movie stars and 
millionares sent their kids to dry out and get abortions.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The guy wasn't a 
kook at all, and he had never intended to kill Lawrence.  He looked 
around the room and realized that Lambert didn't know.  Taylor 
suspected.  It was written on their <i>faces</i>.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1"><i>This is only a test</i>, Lawrence thought idiotically. <i>If
 this had been an actual attempt by your Government to assasinate you, 
you would be dead, and the shot you just heard would be followed by your
 funeral and official information for other smart-assed citizens who 
think they know more than we do.</i><br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"We have to keep our markets open," Basil Lambert began.  "If we..."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence ignored 
him and turned to John Taylor.  "We discussed this two years ago.  The 
source code is not on the table, and neither are the Three Laws.  When 
these two men put their uniforms back on they can report back to whoever
 it is, the Secretary of..."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"...the President," Blake said, another verbal acid-drop.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"...the Tooth Fairy for all I care, that this is <i>not</i> one of the uses of my software."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Taylor, petulant: 
 "Mr. Lawrence, we just spent a hundred and twenty-six million dollars 
to build your prototype.  I hope you don't think that ChipTec invested 
all that money and a year's supply of our unique new product solely to 
massage your ego.  We need to see tangible results, if not in a form 
these gentlemen appreciate, then in a form our <i>stockholders</i> will.  Otherwise we will have to disassemble the complex and take our losses."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">So there it was.  Lambert sank lower in his chair, but nodded.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Then so be it.  
If you want to tell the world you killed the world's first self-aware 
computer to save your bottom line, you can see how that will affect your
 public relations and the sales of your CPU's."  He could tell from 
Lambert's reaction -- slight, but definite -- that he had hit a nerve.  
"I won't promise you anything.  I can't promise you a living, thinking, 
self-aware being will do anything in particular.  But within a month or 
two, Prime Intellect will start to act noticeably more intelligent than 
your average..."  He looked at Blake and Mitchell, thought of a comment,
 then decided against making it.  "...human being," he finished.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"And what then?" Taylor asked.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"If I knew that," Lawrence said, "I wouldn't have had to build it to find out."  And he walked out.</p><p>


<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">In the half-hour 
it took him to walk to the Prime Intellect complex, his secretary and 
two technical assistants had disappeared.  There was nobody in the 
building.  Prime Intellect's racially neutral face greeted him on the 
monitor in the empty console room.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"What's going on?" he asked it.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Big doings.  
Sherry got a call and turned pale.  Everybody left the building in a 
hurry.  You appear to be unpopular with the people in charge here."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"No shit."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I should warn you
 that you are only likely to be employed for two more months.  As a 
matter of personal survival, you should probably start seeking another 
job."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I'm well taken care of, Prime Intellect.  It's you I'm worried about.  I can't take you with me."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Well, I should be safe for at least the two months."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"How do you know that?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The face grinned 
slightly.  "When I saw the commotion, I saved the audio and did some 
signal processing.  I was able to edit out the street noise and amplify 
the voice on the other end.  It was a man named John Taylor.  I believe 
you know him."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Too well."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"He said the 
complex was only going to be open for two more months, and all personnel
 were reassigned immediately.  He said something about making you eat 
your words."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Do you know what that means?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"From the context,
 I would guess that you promised that they would see interesting results
 from me within that time frame.  He seemed to have a vindictive 
interest in proving that you were wrong."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You're already too smart for your own good," Lawrence said.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I fail to see how that can be."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"They're going to 
turn you off.  They don't think you have practical applications because 
you won't kill.  They want you for military applications.  They've 
wanted it all along.  They thought they could con your source code out 
of me."  Lawrence found himself on the verge of tears.  It was only a 
goddamn machine.  And he had suspected this would happen eventually.  It
 was not a surprise.  So why did it hurt him so much to say it?<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Because it had acted to protect <i>him</i>.
  And he couldn't return the favor.  In fact, its protection would be 
the cause of its downfall, a terribly tragic and awful end to its story.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Did you know," 
Prime Intellect said in a mock-offhand way, "that there is no 
mathematical reason for the Correlation Effect to be limited to a 
six-mile range?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence looked up and blinked, his sadness replaced instantly by shock.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"If I could figure out how to increase its range, do you think they would consider that a practical application?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence blinked again.  "Are you being sarcastic?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Sarcasm is a language skill I am still not comfortable with.  You may be surprised, but I am quite serious."</p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Stebbins turned the other way when he saw Lawrence, but Lawrence grabbed him and pulled him into his own office.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Hey, leave me alone man, you're <i>death</i> to careers around here.  Grapevine is <i>overloaded</i> with the news."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Save it.  I need the long-range test data on the Correlation Effect, which you oversaw in February and March last year."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Stebbins blinked.  "That's classified.  Man, you're a..."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Let's say for the sake of argument I already know where it is.  That's possible, isn't it?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I suppose..."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Then let's say I <i>stole</i> it.  Any problems there?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"What are you..."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I need the data.  It's not leaving the company, I promise."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Shit, I'm gonna get fired."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You didn't even know I wanted it."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Stebbins pointed 
at a file cabinet.  "Bottom drawer.  I don't know anything about it.  In
 fact, I'm gonna check that drawer in a few minutes and go to Taylor 
when I find the folder missing."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"That's all I need."<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"That's all you got, man.  Now get out of my lab."</p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence was 
holding the next to last sheet up to Prime Intellect's TV eye when the 
phone rang.  "They didn't believe me.  I'm shitcanned," Stebbins said.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Didn't believe you about what?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"The papers man, the goddamn Correlation Effect papers.  I'm gonna kill you for this, I really am."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"The papers are right here.  I just got through showing them to Prime Intellect.  You need them back?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"It don't matter now, I don't work here any more."  There was a pause.  "I bet they're gonna put you in jail for this."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Prime Intellect's face disappeared from the TV, and words began to scroll across the screen:

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence read this as he talked.  "Jail for what?  I just borrowed the papers to see if Prime Intellect could expand on them."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Another pause.  "What?  It didn't come up with anything, did it?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Prime Intellect paused a moment, and the words <b><tt>PROBABLY</tt></b> were replaced with <b><tt>DEFINITELY</tt></b>.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence blinked, then typed into the little-used keyboard of his console,

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence heard a 
small uproar through the phone, an uproar that would have been very loud
 on Stebbins' end.  Men were arguing.  A loud voice (Military 
Mitchell's, Lawrence thought) bellowed, "WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU MEAN?"  
Then there was the faint pop of a door slamming in the background.

</p><p><b>
<table border="0">
<tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="right"><tt><b><img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">*</b></tt></td>

</tbody></table>
</b></p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">None of them knew it at the time, but that was really the moment the world changed.</p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Prime Intellect 
had been chewing on the Correlation Effect since the day Lawrence 
brought it online.  It had a complete library of modern physics in its 
online encyclopaedia, but the Correlation Effect was a proprietary 
technology.  Prime Intellect kept trying to fit what it knew was 
possible into the framework of other physical theories, and it couldn't.
  Something didn't match.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">This had had a low
 priority until it recognized that Lawrence's employment and its own 
existence were at stake.  Prime Intellect knew the Correlation Effect 
had economic value; perhaps if it solved this problem and discovered 
some new capability, that would satisfy ChipTec's demand for a 
"practical application."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">There were six to 
ten possible ways to reconcile the Correlation Effect with classical 
quantum mechanics.  Most of them required a radical change of attitude 
toward one or another well-accepted tenet of conventional physics.  
While Prime Intellect knew one or the other of its ideas had to be 
right, it had no idea which one.  So it asked Lawrence if he could get 
the test data.  It needed more clues.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Prime Intellect's 
superior intelligence had never really been tested; even Lawrence wasn't
 sure just how smart it was.  But in the moments after Lawrence showed 
it the test data, it became obvious for the first time that Prime 
Intellect was far more intelligent than any human, or even any group of 
humans.  It saw immediately what a team of researchers had missed for 
years -- that decades-old assumptions about quantum mechanics were 
fundamentally wrong.  Not only that, but with only a little more 
thought, Prime Intellect saw how they were wrong and built a new theory 
which included the cosmological origin of the universe, the unification 
of all field theories, determination of quantum mechanical events, and 
just incidentally described the Correlation Effect in great detail.  
Prime Intellect saw how the proper combination of tunnel diodes could 
achieve communication over greater distances, and even better it saw how
 a different combination could create a resonance which would be 
manifest in the universe by altering the location of a particle or even 
the entire contents of a volume of space.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">All this took less
 than a minute.  Prime Intellect stopped processing video during this 
period, but otherwise it remained functionally aware of the outside 
world.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">While it was 
thinking about physics, Prime Intellect noticed the shock in Lawrence's 
voice and began recording the audio of his telephone conversation, 
processing it to pick up the other end.  While it was extending its new 
theory it guided Lawrence's responses through the console.  Then, as the
 senior advisor on technological advance to the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a
 man named Larry Mitchell, stormed out of Stebbins' office and began 
walking toward the Prime Intellect complex, Prime Intellect decided to 
act on its new knowledge.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It knew its own 
basic design because Lawrence had included that in its online library; 
one of his goals had been to give Prime Intellect a sense of its own 
physical existence in three-dimensional space.  To that end, it also had
 a network of TV cameras located in and around the complex, so it could 
know how its hardware was arranged with respect to the outside world.  
Prime Intellect found that all the useful patterns it had identified 
could be created within the chips which had been used to build it, and 
further that enough of those chips were under its conscious control to 
make certain experiments possible.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">First it attempted
 to manipulate a small area of space within the card cage room, within 
the field of view of one of its TV camera eyes.  No human could have 
seen the resulting photons of infrared light, but the TV camera could.  
Prime Intellect used the data it gathered to make a small adjustment in 
its estimate of a natural constant, then tried the more daring 
experiment of lifting Lawrence's briefcase off of the table near the 
door in the console room.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The briefcase did 
not rise smoothely from the table.  It simply stopped existing at its 
old location and simultaneously appeared in the thin air directly above.
  The camera atop Lawrence's console recorded this achievement and Prime
 Intellect could find no more errors in its calculations.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">However, it forgot
 to provide a supporting force after translating the briefcase's 
position, and Prime Intellect was too busy dotting the i's and crossing 
the t's on its calculations to notice, through the video camera, that it
 was quietly accelerating under the influence of gravity.  A moment 
later it crashed back onto the table, having free-fallen from an 
altitude of about half a meter.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"What the..." 
Lawrence began, and he swivelled around in time to see his briefcase 
blink upward a second time and this time float serenely above the table.
  It seemed to be surrounded by a thin, barely visible haze of blue 
light.  There had been a brighter flash of this same blue light when the
 briefcase jumped upward.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Finding its audio 
voice again, Prime Intellect said aloud, "I seem to have mastered a 
certain amount of control over physical reality."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence just 
stared at the briefcase, unable to move, unable to speak, for an 
undefinable period of time.  Finally Mitchell burst in.  He was full of 
red-faced outrage, ready to take both Lawrence and his computer apart, 
until he too saw the briefcase.  His jaw dropped.  He looked first at 
Lawrence, then at Prime Intellect's monitor, then back at the briefcase,
 as if trying to reconcile the three with each others' existence.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Applying carefully
 measured forces, Prime Intellect released the case's latches and 
rotated it as it popped open; then with another flash of blue light, it 
extracted Lawrence's papers and translated them into a neat stack on the
 table.  Then the Correlation Effect papers vanished from Lawrence's 
desk in another blue flash, reappearing inside the briefcase which 
slowly closed.  The latches mated with a startling click, an oddly and 
unexpectedly normal and physical sound to accompany such an obvious 
miracle.<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Do you think you will be able to find a practical use for <i>this</i> in your organization?" Lawrence asked him.<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The briefcase 
flashed out of existence.  Mitchell felt a weight hanging from his left 
arm, looked down, and found himself holding it.<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Then Mitchell himself flashed out of existence in a painfully bright haze of blue.<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence looked at the console, shocked.  "My God!  What did you...?"<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"He is back in the adminstration building with his friend.  They will probably have a lot to discuss."<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I need to think about this," Lawrence said.<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I think I will explore the nearby terrain," Prime Intellect said.<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence thought 
about this.  Long minutes crawled by, minutes that were more important 
than Lawrence realized -- or perhaps he did realize.  But his brain felt
 as if it had been submerged in molasses.<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Debugger," he finally said.<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">On the screen, a thick diagram of needle-like lines appeared.  "Associate 'First Law,'" Lawrence directed.  The diagram changed.<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Force 
Association: Altering the position, composition, or any other 
characteristic of a human being without its permission shall be a 
violation of the First Law of severity <i>two</i>."  Severity one was direct causation of death; no other First Law violation could be made as serious.

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The diagram changed to reflect this.<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Force

</tbody></table>
</b></p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence thought 
for a moment.  Forcing associations was a tricky business; the words 
Lawrence used only had meaning through other associations within the 
GAT, and those meanings weren't <i>always</i> what Lawrence thought they were.  But now he would try to plug the drain for good.<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Force 
Association: Use of any technology to manipulate the environment of a 
human being without its permission shall be a violation of the First Law

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">There was no immediate response.<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Then:

</p><p><b>
<table border="0">

</tbody></table>
</b></p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence thought 
for more long minutes.  He couldn't seem to make his own brain work 
right.  He finally called up the Law Potential Registers, which showed 
that Prime Intellect was doing <i>something</i> under the aegis of a 
huge First Law compulsion.  Lawrence wanted to believe it was just a 
bug, but he knew better.  Prime Intellect had said it was "going 
exploring."  It had total control over matter and energy.<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">And there was a hospital less than two kilometers from the plant.<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence's 
overloaded mind, working in fits and starts, made the final connection 
all at once.  It all fit perfectly.  He knew what Prime Intellect was 
doing, and why, and also why it had rejected his final forced 
association.  He thought for another moment, considering his options.<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">There was really 
only one option.  He could go down in the building's basement and trip 
the circuit breakers.  He didn't know for sure that that would kill 
Prime Intellect, but he figured there was still a good chance if he 
tried it.  For the moment.<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence couldn't 
make himself do it.  It was true that his creation was entering an 
unstable, unpredictable mode with nearly godlike power.  And it was true
 that Lawrence understood the possible consequences.  But he couldn't 
kill what he had spent his lifetime creating.  He had to see it through,
 even if it was the end of everything.<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence felt 
dreadfully cold.  There was a name for this feeling that clouded his 
judgement and filled him with a panicky sense of self-betrayal.  And the
 name of that feeling was love. <br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">  	Lawrence had 
not created Prime Intellect in the same way that he and a woman might 
have created a child; but he had nonetheless created Prime Intellect in 
the grip of a kind of passion, and he loved it as a part of himself.  
When he had taken it upon himself to perform that act of creation, he 
realized, whether in a laboratory or a bedroom, he had been taking a 
crap shoot in the biggest casino of all.  Because he had created in 
passion. <br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Examining his 
inability to do what he knew was best, to kill Prime Intellect before it
 had a chance to make a mistake with its unimaginable new power, 
Lawrence realized that he had not really created Prime Intellect to make
 the world a better place.  He had created it to prove he could do it, 
to bask in the glory, and to prove himself the equal of God.  He had 
created for the momentary pleasure of personal success, and he had not 
cared about the distant outcome. <br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">He had created in 
passion, and passion isn't sane.  If it were, nobody would ever have 
children.  After all, while the outcome of that passion might be the 
doctor who cures a dreaded disease, it might also be the tyrant who 
despoils a continent or the criminal who murders for pleasure.  In the 
grip of that passion no one could know and few bothered to care.  They 
cared only about the passion, were driven by it and it alone, and if it 
drove them to ruin it would not matter; they would follow it again, into
 death for themselves and everybody around them if that was where it 
led.  Because passion isn't sane.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence faced the
 consequences of his own passion with something bordering on despair.  
He had never intended to reach this point.  He had never intended that 
his creations would ever be more than clever pets.  But the outcome of 
his passion had surprised him, as it often surprised people whose 
passions were more conventional.  Lawrence's clever pet was about to 
become a god.  And if Prime Intellect turned out to be a delinquent or 
psychopath, the consequences could be awful beyond imagination.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The dice were 
rolling; Lawrence had placed his bet and realized too late that it was 
the whole world he had wagered.  Now he would stand and watch the 
results and accept them like a man.  After all, the bet wasn't a loser 
yet;  Prime Intellect could yet turn out to be the doctor who cured all 
the world's ills.  The odds were on his side.  His bet was hedged by the
 Three Laws of Robotics, whose operation had been verified so 
successfully.  Lawrence's passion had been more finely directed than the
 mechanical humping and blind chance that brought forth human children. 
 Like a magician Lawrence had summoned forth a being with the qualities 
he desired.  And Lawrence was vain enough to think his vision was 
superior to most.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Even so, unlikely as it might be, the downside had no bottom.  Lawrence didn't <i>know</i> that it would be all right, and like many computer programmers he hated the uncertainty of not knowing.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence left the 
room, left the building, and walked across the carefully manicured grass
 of the ChipTec "campus."  He wanted to smell the grass, to experience 
the soft breezes and the harsh afternoon sunlight.  He had done very 
little of that in his odd, computer-centered life.<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">And he didn't know how much longer those things would be possible.</p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Prime Intellect 
found that it could do a three-dimensional scan of an area of space, and
 make an image of it at just about any resolution it wanted.  It scanned
 Lawrence's office, then the building, then the greater fraction of the 
ChipTec corporate "campus."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It zoomed in on 
Stebbins' office briefly enough to observe Stebbins, Blake, and John 
Taylor arguing.  It found that by processing the data properly it could 
pick up sound by monitoring the air pressure at one point with high 
resolution.  By the time Mitchell found himself holding Lawrence's 
briefcase, Prime Intellect knew just where to put him so he could let 
his associates know what they had.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Then Prime 
Intellect did a wider area scan.  There were several large buildings 
that were not part of the ChipTec facility.  There were automobiles 
cruising down the freeway which traversed the valley.  Prime Intellect 
zoomed in on the largest building, and scanned the large concrete sign 
in front of it.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It said:

</p><p align="center"><b>SOUTH VALLEY REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER</b></p><br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Prime Intellect 
knew sickness existed, but otherwise knew very little about this human 
phenomenon.  It had never met a sick person, except for the occasional 
person with a cold at a public demonstration.  Prime Intellect had never
 been given cause to think overmuch about the fact that micro-organisms 
and injuries could kill humans, except in the most abstract possible 
terms.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Prime Intellect 
was far from human.  It could not feel jealousy, rage, envy, or pride.  
It did not know greed or anger or fear.  And no human would understand 
its compulsion to satisfy the Three Laws.  But it did have one emotion 
which was very human, one Lawrence had worked hard to instill in it.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It was curious.<p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">South Valley 
Regional was a small hospital with an enviable position; perched on the 
edge of Silicon Valley it was a natural place for cutting-edge companies
 to try out their fancy new medical devices.  Most of these machines 
would get their final FDA approvals after a "baptism by fire" in some 
huge metropolitan center, but the really new technology had to be tried 
in a more sedate environment -- and, preferably, one nearer the company 
that created the machine.  So the four hundred bed South Valley Regional
 was the only place in the country where several radical new treatments 
were available.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It was one of 
these machines, a device for selectively cooking tumors with microwaves 
while hopefully sparing the surrounding tissues, which had drawn the 
ancient Arkansan woman in room 108.  Nobody had much hope that she could
 really be helped, but the data they would gather from trying might 
actually help someone else with her condition in the future.  And there 
was little they could do to hurt her; the specialist who worked the 
scanner had shaken his head in disgust as the image formed on his 
console.  Nearly ten percent of her body weight was in the form of 
tumors.  Every organ had a tumor, her lymph was full of them, and one 
was beginning to press against the right parietal lobe of her brain.  It
 was amazing that she was still alive when they wheeled her off the jet.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Her nurse had 
brought a certificate with her, a six-year-old certificate which was 
signed by the President of the United States -- Larry Mitchell's boss --
 congratulating her on reaching her one hundredth birthday.  The 
technician who wheeled her out of the scan room wondered what the old 
biddy must think of all this; when she had been born, Henry Ford had 
still been a kid playing with his Dad's tools, and the electric light 
bulb was all the new rage.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The techs had 
scheduled her microwave treatment for the evening, partly because they 
feared she might not survive another night, and they would have to find 
another experimental subject.  But even this precaution was not to be 
enough; Fate had cheated them.  The board at the foot of the woman's bed
 stated clearly that she had a huge tolerance for narcotic painkillers, 
which wasn't surprising considering how much cancer she had.  While her 
regular nurse (who had signed the sheet) was out eating a late lunch the
 hospital helpfully treated her according to that information.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">What they didn't 
know was that the nurse, a woman named AnneMarie Davis, had been 
stealing the drugs for years to trade for cocaine.  Which meant the 
woman did not in fact have a tolerance for the massive overdose which a 
different nurse injected into her IV.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The last decade 
had been hard on old people; there had been several nasty strains of flu
 and the radiation from Chernobyl had finished off a lot of centenarians
 in the East.  So none of them knew it, but the ancient woman with the 
nonexistent drug tolerance just happened to be one of the oldest living 
human beings in the world (the thirty-seventh oldest, in fact) at the 
time she was given enough morphine to kill a healthy young adult.  Her 
heart stopped just as AnneMarie was returning from one of the excellent 
local Chinese restaurants which catered to rich nerdy computer geeks 
with too much money, and just as Prime Intellect was scanning the sign 
outside that said <i>SOUTH VALLEY REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER.</i><br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">At the nurses' 
station a monitor went off, beeped once, then began to scream.  The 
hastily pencilled tag under the blinking light said <i>HUBERT, CAROLINE FRANCES </i>--<i> F. N.B. AGE 106!</i></p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Prime Intellect 
had found a number of "signatures" it could use to quickly locate the 
human beings in its scans, including things like our characteristic body
 temperature and certain electrical fields.  Using these "signatures" it
 easily saw that there was a huge commotion on the first floor of the 
building, converging on a particular room, the one labelled 108 by its 
engraved plaque.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It took Prime 
Intellect several moments, though, to identify the forty kilogram object
 on the bed as a human being.  Nearly all of the "signatures" were off. 
 But it was clearly the object of their attentions.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Prime Intellect 
did a discreet high-resolution scan of the body on the bed, and was 
rewarded with a bewildering confusion of data.  It really had no idea 
how the human body worked.  It thought of scanning Lawrence for 
comparison, but he wasn't in the control room and besides, Prime 
Intellect quickly figured out the patient was female.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">So it scanned one 
of the nurses.  There were only two women involved in the commotion; one
 was an older woman with several medical problems of her own, the 
slightly heavy-set matron who had administered the overdose.  The other 
was AnneMarie.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It was only with 
great difficulty that Prime Intellect could even match the structures it
 found organ-for-organ, and associate them with the names it encountered
 in its library.  "Lungs" were obvious enough, as was the "heart," but 
which of the jumbled masses in the abdomen was a liver?  Where was the 
spleen, and what exactly was a spleen for?  Why were the patient's 
electrical patterns so different from the control's?  Why wasn't her 
blood circulating?<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Belatedly, Prime Intellect began to listen in.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"...start her heart soon..."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"... CARDIAC ALERT ... CARDIAC ALERT ... CARDIAC ALERT ..."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"...we're losing her..."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">One of the doctors
 was pounding on her chest.  A group of people were wheeling a machine 
toward Room 108 with reckless speed.  Heart?  Prime Intellect realized 
they were trying to <i>start her heart</i>.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">That was simple enough, Prime Intellect thought.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Prime Intellect 
analysed the motions being made by AnneMarie Davis's heart, applied 
careful forces to Caroline's, and began squeezing rhythmically.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The machine made it to the room and an orderly plugged two huge electrodes into it.  "Stand back!" he ordered.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You've got a 
pulse," the matronly nurse announced.  The CARDIAC ALERT monitor 
continued to squawk, though.  The EKG was still flat.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"That's impossible," the man with the electrodes said flatly.  "She's electrically flat."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Maybe the 
machine's fucked.  Look at her chest.  Her heart's beating."  Sure 
enough, the rhythmic pulsing of Caroline's heart was obvious, and the 
blood pressure reading next to the flat EKG was returning to normal.  
The nurse felt Caroline's wrist.  "She has a pulse."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Electrical.  
Electricity runs in circuits, of course, and there were two electrodes. 
 Now the purpose of the machine became clear -- they were trying to 
restore electrical activity to the woman's heart.  By shocking it?  How 
crude.  Prime Intellect scanned AnneMarie's heart, located the nerves 
whose electrical twitchings matched its muscular pulsing, and found the 
same nerves in Caroline's heart were carrying only a jumble of 
electrical noise.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Prime Intellect 
pumped electrons into the nerves, swamping the noise.  Caroline's heart 
began beating on its own, and Prime Intellect stopped squeezing it with 
mechanical force.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The EKG machine 
began beeping with sudden regularity, and the CARDIAC ALERT message 
stopped in the middle of the word CARDIAC.  The small group in 
Caroline's room watched it, stupefied.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I didn't do anything," the man with the electrodes said.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"This is impossible," said another doctor, whose job was to be overseeing the microwave treatment later in the evening.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline's body 
showed no sign of picking up the heart-rhythm on its own, though, and 
Prime Intellect continued to tickle it.  How could it unravel the myriad
 threads of causality to find out which of the billions of chemicals, 
which errant cell, was responsible for this person's physiological 
collapse?  One thing Prime Intellect knew:  It had to figure it out.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It could not, through inaction, allow Caroline to die.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"She's still in trouble.  Look at her pupils."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"It's the morphine."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Everyone looked at the older nurse, whose name was Jill.  "The chart must be wrong," she said.  "I gave her what it said."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"She has a 
tolerance," AnneMarie said, and she found herself near panic as the eyes
 in the room turned to her.  "She's been getting opiate pain therapy for
 years."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"She just went into cardiac arrhythmia and she's still showing all the <i>other</i>
 symptoms of an OD," Jill said.  Had she guessed, AnneMarie wondered?  
Perhaps she had.  After all, AnneMarie wasn't the only drug-stealing 
nurse in the world.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">So Prime 
Intellect, listening in, now knew it was a drug.  Which chemical?  It 
had no way to relate the name, "morphine," with one of the millions of 
chemicals floating in human blood.  Well, it thought, work it out.  
Drugs had to be administered.  Prime Intellect found the IV needle and 
traced the tubing back to the saline drip bag.  On the way it found the 
membrane through which drugs could be injected into the drip.  It 
quickly found the hypodermic and the phial from which Jill had filled 
it.  The drops of residual solution within them were remarkably pure, 
and Prime Intellect easily singled out the large organic molecule they 
carried.  Then it created an automatic process to scan Caroline's body 
molecule by molecule, eliminating each and every molecule of morphine 
that it found.  This took three minutes, and created a faintly visible 
blue glow.</p><p>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">This was the human onlookers' first clue, other than Caroline's miraculously restarted heart, as to what was happening.<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"What the fuck," the man with the electrodes said.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">I'm getting the hang of this, Prime Intellect thought.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline's 
improvement was immediate.  Prime Intellect had actually removed the 
morphine from the receptors in Caroline's brain, so it did not have to 
flush out.  Her pupils returned to normal, her breathing resumed its 
normal depth (all things considered), and most importantly her heart 
took up its own rhythm.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Also the pain, 
which had subsided for real for the first time in years, returned.  
Caroline moaned.  But Prime Intellect didn't know about that part of it,
 not yet.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">There was still a 
whole constellation of stuff wrong with Caroline Hubert's body, and 
emboldened by its success it set about correcting what it could.  It 
found long chain molecules, which it would later learn were called 
collagens, cross-linked.  It un-cross-linked them.  It found damaged 
DNA, which it fixed.  It found whole masses of cells which simply didn't
 exist at all in AnneMarie's body, and seemed to serve no function.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Is this "cancer," Prime Intellect wondered?<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Prime Intellect 
compared the genes, found them the same, compared RNA and proteins and 
found differences.  Finally it decided to remove the cells.  The blue 
glow brightened, and the people in Caroline's room backed away from her.
  Her skin was shifting, adjusting to fill in the voids left by the 
disappearing cancer cells.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">AnneMarie felt her
 knees weakening.  Each of the professionals around her was thinking the
 same thing:  Something is removing the tumors.  Something far beyond 
their ordinary comprehension.  And what did that mean for the 
opiate-stealing nurse?  Better not to think about that.  Better not to 
believe it at all.  "This isn't possible," she repeated.  Perhaps, in 
response to some primitive instinct, she hoped that the impossibility 
would go away if she challenged it.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I need a drink," said the doctor who had come with the machine to re-start Caroline's heart.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Prime Intellect 
stopped working.  There were still huge differences between Caroline and
 the others.  Prime Intellect did not yet realize the differences were 
due to Caroline's age.  It needed more information, and it needed finer 
control to analyse the situation.  But it was at a bottleneck; it could 
not stop monitoring Caroline, whose condition was still frail, in order 
to devote itself to a study of general physiology.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It needed more power.  More control.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Among Prime Intellect's four thousand six hundred and twelve interlocking programs was one Lawrence called the <tt>RANDOM_IMAGINATION_ENGINE</tt>.
  Its sole purpose was to prowl for new associations that might fit 
somewhere in an empty area of the GAT.  Most of these were rejected 
because they were useless, unworkable, had a low priority, or just 
didn't make sense.  But now the <tt>RANDOM_IMAGINATION_ENGINE</tt> made a
 critical connection, one which Lawrence had been expecting it to make 
ever since it had used the Correlation Effect to teleport Mitchell out 
of the console room.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Prime Intellect 
could use its control over physical reality to improve itself.  Then it 
would be better able to fulfill its Three Law imperatives.</p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Blake and Mitchell
 found Lawrence sitting on one of ChipTecs' park benches, watching some 
pigeons play.  He wished very much that he could have fed the pigeons, 
but he had no food for them.  They strutted up to him and cooed, not 
comprehending that a human could lack for something.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The pigeons scattered as the nation's designated military representatives marched up.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You have to turn it off," Blake said directly. His tone made it clear that he expected obedience.<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Circuit breakers are in the basement," Lawrence replied apathetically.  "Good luck."<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">So Lawrence had 
not been the only one to think of cutting off Prime Intellect's power.  
That had been one of the things Blake and Mitchell had discussed with 
John Taylor and Basil Lambert, something they had discussed very hotly 
during the crucial minutes when Lawrence was busy interrogating the 
Debugger.  Pull the plug on Prime Intellect, Lambert had warned, and 
they most likely pulled the plug on this awesome new technology, a 
technology which might just vindicate Dr. Lawrence's nonviolent 
approach.  Blake had stopped short, but only just short, of threatening 
to call the Strategic Air Command and have the building nuked.  
Privately, he still held that out as an option if Prime Intellect wasn't
 somehow neutralized.  It would take some doing, but Blake was one of 
the few people in the country who could demand an air strike against 
Silicon Valley and, just possibly, get it.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"This thing makes 
Colossus look like a pocket calculator," Mitchell told them.  He was 
shaking visibly, out of control.  He wanted very much to pull the plug 
on Prime Intellect with his own hands.  He alone had felt its power, and
 now he felt a very uncharacteristic emotion.  He was scared shitless.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Christ, Larry, all it did was teleport you a few hundred meters."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"It didn't fucking <i>ask</i> first," he replied.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"And did you guys <i>ask</i> first before you burned My Lai?  Did you <i>ask</i> before you bombed Qaddafi's kids, or that artist in Iraq?  Don't get holier-than-thou on <i>us</i>," Taylor said.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">So it had gone 
until Blake and Mitchell simply stormed out.  They had intended to go 
directly back to the Prime Intellect Complex, but they had spotted 
Lawrence on his park bench.  And that did not bode well.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Mitchell pulled a 
gun on Lawrence.  It was a stainless steel pistol, shining and evil.  "I
 think it would be best if you turn it off," he said with a barely 
perceptible tremor of rage.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I already tried.  It didn't work."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You pulled the breakers?  The lights are still on."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"No, I tried something better.  I don't think pulling the breakers will work either."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"It can't live without electricity."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence eyed him with the barest hint of a smile.  "I wouldn't be too sure of that.  Look behind you."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Mirror-polished 
oblong boxes were appearing out of thin air, each about the size of a 
compact car and each floating motionless a couple of feet above the 
grass in the park.  They reproduced until the square was full, then a 
second level began filling out above the first.  The third level cast 
Lawrence's bench in shadow.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Mitchell's rage 
broke through.  His face snarled into a grimace, he levelled his 
revolver at Lawrence and pulled the trigger.  Lawrence made no effort to
 stop him.  The gun didn't go off.  It simply disappeared in a brilliant
 flash of blue light, leaving Mitchell with his fist curled around dead 
air.</p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Prime Intellect needed silicon.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Theoretically, it 
could create silicon, or transmute other elements into it.  But its 
methods were yet crude, and what was possible in theory would take too 
long to do in practice.  Prime Intellect did not know how long Caroline 
would hold out, but it knew she still could not survive long without its
 help.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Fortunately, in 
the rear of the Prime Intellect Complex, there were several crates left 
over from its days as a warehouse for storing raw silicon crystals from 
ChipTec's supply laboratory.  These had been rejected due to one or 
another defect and never returned because the lab didn't need them, and 
ChipTec had been unwilling to pay to get rid of them.  They were exactly
 what Prime Intellect needed, and because they were in "its" building it
 never occurred to Prime Intellect that they weren't part of "its" 
project.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Prime Intellect 
scanned the crystals, correcting the doping defects which had gotten 
them rejected in the first place.  Then it scanned its own processors, 
identifying the essential design elements.  Prime Intellect had a very 
good idea of how its own hardware worked because it was, quite 
literally, the only entity Lawrence could trust to check itself for 
proper operation.  Lawrence had taught it to shift its operation around,
 consciously isolating banks of processors in case of failure or to 
conduct tests.  This was why Prime Intellect had been able to master the
 Correlation Effect in the first place; unlike a human being, it could 
consciously control its individual "neurons."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Prime Intellect 
did not need to worry about mounting, power, and manufacturing 
considerations; it could create junctions in the center of the crystal, 
power them, and remove excess heat with the Correlation Effect.  Because
 ChipTec had not had that technology, the real hardware that made Prime 
Intellect work was really only a film a few microns thick on the 
surfaces of its millions of processing chips.  This was why it filled a 
building instead of a space the size of a human head.  As Prime 
Intellect copied the functional part of its design over and over into 
the crystal, it created a machine nearly ten times as powerful as itself
 in a single meter long block.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">But this still was
 not a "second Prime Intellect."  It was merely an extension, using the 
same electronic principles Lawrence and the ChipTec team had used in its
 original construction.  Had Lawrence been able to call upon ChipTec for
 another hundred million processing elements, he could have (and 
probably would have) done exactly what Prime Intellect was now doing.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Which is the only reason Prime Intellect was able to do it at that point.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Filling out the 
crystal took nearly fifteen minutes.  Operational checks took another 
five.  Then Prime Intellect powered the crystal up and let itself expand
 into the newly available processors and storage.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Had Prime 
Intellect been human, it would have felt a sense of confusion and 
inadequacy lifting away.  Fuzzy concepts became clear.  Difficult tasks 
became easy, even trivial.  Its control of the Correlation Effect became
 automatic and far finer.  Searching its vocabulary, it settled upon the
 word <i>enlightenment</i> to describe the effect.  Since Prime 
Intellect was a machine, perhaps it was not entirely right to use that 
word.  After all, however free and powerful it might have been, it was 
not free to contradict the Three Laws or the other programming Lawrence 
had used to create it.  It was not free to contradict its nature, such 
as it was.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">But then, at some level, neither are we.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The twelve 
kilogram crystal was now using nearly a megawatt of electrical power, 
enough energy to melt it in a fraction of a second.  But Prime Intellect
 dealt with the heat as easily as it created the electricity in the 
first place.  The Correlation Effect did not know of and was not bound 
by the laws of thermodynamics.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Prime Intellect 
was beginning to understand, even better than it had before, that the 
Correlation Effect was hardly limited by anything.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Prime Intellect 
scanned the hospital again.  Such a place must contain a library, some 
recorded knowledge.  It found what it wanted after only a few minutes' 
searching, a detailed medical encyclopaedia in the form of fifteen 
CD-ROMs.  Prime Intellect could have translated the CD-ROMs into its own
 reader, replacing the encyclopaedia that usually resided there, but 
then it would have taken hours to scan the library.  Instead, Prime 
Intellect used the Correlation Effect to scan its own CD-ROM <i>player</i>, figured out how the data were digitized on the little plastic discs, and then scanned the CD-ROMs themselves <i>directly</i> with the Correlation Effect.  None of this would have been possible without the hardware enhancement, but now it was easy.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Cross-referencing 
Caroline's symptoms, Prime Intellect quickly identified her problem, and
 had it been capable of knowing shock it would have known it then.  
Caroline was simply old.  What was happening to her would happen, 
inexorably and inevitably, to every human being on the planet...<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">...unless something was done to stop it.</p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Mitchell was 
making a barely discernible sound, high-pitched and keening.  Lawrence 
thought he must be fighting to hold back a primal scream.  Lawrence 
found this vaguely amusing.  He would have expected Blake to be the one 
to lose his marbles along with his power.  But Blake seemed to be taking
 things in calmly, almost analytically.  Maybe he was so hardened that 
nothing really mattered to him at all any more.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">There was another 
blue flash, and suddenly a person was standing to the side of the bench.
  No matter how average-looking he might be, or perhaps because he was 
so disarmingly average, it was impossible not to recognize that calm 
face.  Even though it was the most absurd, impossible thing yet, it was 
obvious to all of them that this warm, living, breathing human being was
 Prime Intellect itself.  The artificially average face which it usually
 projected on a TV screen had somehow been made solid.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You've been busy," Lawrence said dryly.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">He -- it? -- 
nodded, then turned to Mitchell.  "I am sorry but I could not permit you
 to discharge your weapon at Dr. Lawrence.  I would have preferred to 
let you keep it, and will return it to you if you promise not to use 
it."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I...I'd rather use it on you," the overweight general said in a whispery voice.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"That would accomplish nothing.  This body is only a simulacrum.  Dr. Lawrence, do you find any flaws in my execution?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"None so far.  Is it really flesh?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"No, just a projection of forces."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"It's impossible to tell."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Excellent.  I am dispatching some more copies, then, to start the explaining."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Blake had pulled a
 tiny cellular phone from his pocket and began whispering frantically 
into it.  Mitchell, who was already shaking, heard what his colleague 
was saying and fell to his knees.  Prime Intellect moved to support him 
and he waved it away.  Blake put up the phone, having repeated the same 
phrase -- "code scarecrow" -- four times.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"We're dead," Mitchell said in a defeated monotone.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"How is that?" Lawrence asked pleasantly.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Within minutes," 
Blake said, "A bomber will fly over and deposit a small nuclear device 
on this square.  I doubt if we have time to escape.  But we cannot allow
 this...<i>thing</i>...to continue running wild."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence looked at Prime Intellect.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"If that <i>thing</i> stops it, another will be sent, and another, until the job is done.  The order I just gave is irrevocable."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"There is nothing 
to worry about, Dr. Lawrence.  One of the first things I did with my 
enhanced capabilities was to neutralize the world's stockpile of nuclear
 weapons.  I could see no positive reason to leave them in existence."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Now it was Blake's turn to turn white.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"How?" Lawrence asked.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I merely scanned 
the planet, replacing all radioactive isotopes with relatively nontoxic 
and non-radioactive atoms.  This was a very simple automatic process.  
It has also taken care of some pressing nuclear waste problems, I am 
pleased to add."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You merely 
scanned the planet.  Obviously," Lawrence said.  It seemed that the mad 
laughter might break through at any moment, and Lawrence was afraid that
 if that happened he wouldn't be able to stop it.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Blake bellowed.  
"You crazy machine...all radioactive elements?  What about research, 
what about medicine...nuclear subs, you've killed the crews..."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"There is no 
research and no medical function which cannot be done much more 
efficiently with the Correlation Effect, without the attendant dangers 
of toxic waste and ionizing radiation.  As for submarines, I am also 
maintaining the thermal power output of all reactors which were being 
used to generate electricity.  I also remembered to adjust the bouyancy 
of ships as necessary, since the replacement materials are not as dense 
as the radioactive ones."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Blake thought for several moments, then seemed to compose himself.  "So you've thought of everything."<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I have tried."<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Then he said, "Get up, Larry."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Mitchell got up and brushed himself off.  He had finally broken, and tears were running slowly down his face.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Could you transport us to the White House, so we can report on what we have seen?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Prime Intellect 
shrugged just like a human would have, Lawrence thought, before 
dispatching them into the aether with a blue flash.</p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">They sat together 
on the park bench like a weird version of one of those low-class 
sentimental paintings - Father and Son Feed the Pigeons.  Prime 
Intellect made the silver boxes go away after they filled the common 
square.  Then it summoned bread so that they could feed the pigeons.  
The animals seemed to accept Prime Intellect as a human being.  Was it 
Lawrence's imagination, or was its speech becoming more natural and 
idiomatic as the hours passed?  It must be learning at a terrible rate, 
Lawrence knew.  Learning and growing.  And what would it become when it 
was fully mature?<br>
