<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline carefully
 inventoried the ship while her sunburn healed.  It would take a lot of 
planning and a lot of time to do what she had to do; it would probably 
take years.  But she didn't have any shortage of <i>those</i>.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She knew small 
boats could be sailed great distances; several folks had crossed  the 
Atlantic and Pacific oceans in tiny yachts no more than three or four 
meters in length.  But those craft were heavy for their size and would 
need to be built where they could be launched.  Whatever she built she 
would have to carry the pieces through the ship and somehow assemble 
them in one of the areas where a crack gave access to the sea.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She could build a 
raft, but she needed something that could be sailed or rowed with little
 effort.  She figured that if she could manage to average ten kilometers
 per hour, it would take her about two years if the planet was 
comparable in size to the Earth.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">There was a 
surprising abundance of raw materials.  Besides the huge larder, there 
were workshops and batteries and motors and one room completely filled 
with empty cylinders which would make admirable floats.  There were six 
space suits.  There were tubes of goop which turned out to be some kind 
of super adhesive.  There were saws and drills which ran without 
apparent power sources and never seemed to get weak.  There were all 
sorts of electrical test equipment and measuring devices.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline could 
imagine how a lot of this stuff would be used to repair the computer in 
the middle of the ship, but that wasn't her plan.  She kept coming back 
to the empty cylinders, which were each about a meter in diameter and 
about a meter long.  They were heavy, but she could handle them with 
some difficulty.  They were big and they floated; she had to figure out 
how to use them.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">But a simple raft 
wouldn't cut it.  She couldn't trust the super power packs to last long 
enough to propel her across an entire world, and she couldn't row or 
sail a raft.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She found a small handheld device which proved to be an incredibly efficient welding machine.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She thought about it for weeks, and finally came up with a way to do it.  She would build an outrigger canoe.</p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The easiest place 
to build and launch her boat turned out to be the room where she had 
first entered the ship.  Working steadily, she hustled the big cylinders
 down there.  She would alternate them, sealed floats with cylinders 
that had been cut to make storage compartments, until the craft was 
nearly twenty meters long.  Then it would be quite heavy, but she would 
build it in the water.  She found chain and simply moored the incomplete
 portion of her boat to the spaceship.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Cutting and 
pounding and re-welding, she formed two cylinders into tapered cones for
 the bow and stern so her boat would slip easily through the water.  She
 made the outrigger from a single piece of ten-centimeter diameter pipe.
  Because of its length, she couldn't carry it through the ship; she had
 to seal it off where she found it and drop it into the sea from a 
height of nearly thirty meters.  Then she had to dive in after it, and 
guide it back to the construction area from the outside.  She was 
careful to make sure she did this just after sunset, so she wouldn't be 
caught out in the open.  Her sunburn still hadn't completely healed.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">In the center of 
her boat she included three half-cylinders where she would sit and row. 
 Behind these she attached the mast.  She had found sail material, some 
kind of tough plastic sheet that didn't deteriorate even when she left a
 piece of it hanging outside during the brief day.  She had to cut it 
with the same machine that she used on the metal cylinders.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She cut the 
Captain's chair loose and mounted it in her open cockpit.  She mounted 
an arrangement of movable shades which she could quickly hinge up and 
hide behind when the Sun was up.  She fabricated long oars and welded 
them onto hinged oarlocks so she could not lose them -- they were metal 
and would not float.  She paid a lot of attention to the handles of 
these oars and the comfort of her seat.  She would spend a lot of time 
working them.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">One of the most 
difficult tasks was attaching the outrigger and its spars to the main 
hull.  This had to be done outside, and was really a two-person job at 
minimum.  The Sun nearly caught her unfinished, but she made it with 
bare minutes to spare.  The next day she began stocking the compartments
 with food -- enough food for two years -- and tools, including the 
welder and cutter, and cable to rig the sail, and many other things 
which she had carefully thought out.  Fully provisioned, she calculated 
that the boat must weigh a couple of metric tons.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">But that didn't 
matter.  Once it was moving, it would glide easily through the water 
even on its one-woman-power propulsion system.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Finally, 
eighty-six days after she entered the dark ship, she prepared to leave 
it.  She would conduct one circuit of the island, pacing herself, and 
also conducting an important measurement.  As she sailed off, she noted 
how much of the ship remained visible compared to how much of the mesa 
remained visible at various distances.  Calculating carefully in her 
head, she determined that her journey would be about six thousand 
kilometers.  Lawrence's planet was quite a bit smaller than the Earth.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Then she pointed the bow north and began to row.</p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence watched 
these preparations through Prime Intellect's all-seeing eye, and tried 
to gauge Caroline's chances of success.  In the nearly two hundred years
 he had been using this Task to screen his visitors, four or five people
 a day had accepted it.  Most of these were weeded out within hours by 
the sun.  Very few people in Cyberspace were in good enough physical 
shape to swim to the ship, and as Caroline had guessed reaching the ship
 was the key to survival.  Most didn't even try until it was too late.  
Of those who reached the ship many succumbed to the hazards of the 
darkness -- they either slipped through the deliberately planted hole in
 the floor going for the light on level twenty-three, or they succumbed 
to other hazards in the dark.  One had found the flashlight first, but 
he had been extremely lucky.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Then very few of 
those who remained were able to fix the computer and fly the ship 
successfully to his island.  There were a number of things wrong with 
the ship that weren't immediately obvious, and it had a tendency to lose
 power and crash right after takeoff if certain steps weren't taken.  In
 two hundred years, only a couple of hundred visitors had gotten the 
ship's power on.  Less than forty had managed to fix the computer.  And 
only eight had successfully flown it to Lawrence.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Of those eight, 
five had been Death Jockey Gaming junkies who took the challenge just to
 see if they could make it.  They congratulated him on constructing an 
excellent puzzle and left.  The others were fans.  One of these was a 
woman who wanted very much to fuck Lawrence, and because she had gone 
through so much to get to him he did it, though he found the experience 
flat and joyless.  Although he needed the Task to keep himself isolated,
 he really didn't enjoy abusing people.  His heart could only bear so 
much misery and disappointment.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Nobody had ever 
tried building a boat before.  Lawrence had watched her sit in the 
captain's chair and brood, and he knew she had figured out the computer 
was the next step, and had rejected it.  It would be surprising if she 
succeeded, but it was far from impossible.  There were no land masses to
 get in her way, and once she was away from the pole there were steady 
trade winds.  The day would get longer and less severe; the sun was a 
tiny thing in a highly elliptical orbit.  If she chose the right path, 
she could avoid it entirely until it was at a safe distance.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">He wasn't sure 
what had prompted her to come.  At the beginning it had been the two of 
them, Lawrence and Caroline.  He was the creator, and she had been the 
catalyst.  Of course, if it hadn't been her it would have been some 
other sick person, just as some other computer scientist would have 
created the magic Correlation Effect machine if Lawrence hadn't.  But 
that twist of Fate had made them two of the most important people in the
 universe.  Prime Intellect still watched Caroline carefully, and 
brooded at length on her fierce self-destructive streak.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">For nearly six 
hundred years Lawrence had tended Prime Intellect's frozen controls, 
watching carefully for danger signs.  And he still was not sure of its 
long-term stability.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Now Caroline was 
coming to meet him, and whatever she wanted he was sure it would not 
help Prime Intellect's sanity one little bit.  But worried as he was, he
 was a man of his word.  He could simply instruct Prime Intellect to 
swat her down like a bug, hit her with lightning or a tidal wave or 
simply make her disappear.  But having offered up the Task he found 
himself unable to make himself cheat in such a cowardly fashion.  If she
 made it to him, by whatever means, he would hear her out and deal with 
it.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">And then he would make the planet bigger, so it wouldn't happen again.</p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline's first 
day at sea went just as she had planned; she turned the boat broadside 
to the light, and hid behind her metal shield.  But she noticed that the
 day was shorter than she remembered, and that the sun didn't set 
directly opposite the point where it had risen.  It didn't pass directly
 overhead.  Caroline thought about this and then picked her direction 
and began rowing frantically.  On Caroline's second day at sea the sun 
barely peeked above the horizon.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">After that, she didn't need the shield for a long time.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She watched the 
sky carefully, memorizing it.  She quickly noticed that the pattern was 
not constant, but changed slightly from day to day, particularly in the 
fine details.  But the broad strokes were always very similar.  She was 
still able to navigate by the pattern, if only by observing its 
rotation.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She had been in 
good shape before beginning her Task, and had gotten even stronger with 
the physical work of assembling the boat.  Rowing was hard work, but she
 was up to the challenge.  After a couple of days there were cramps from
 the never-changing posture, so she began forcing herself to quit every 
five thousand strokes and climb the length of her boat.  She would climb
 out of the seat, crawl to the bow and touch the tip, then crawl to the 
stern and touch that tip.  Then she would row another five thousand 
strokes.  After ten of these cycles, she allowed herself to sleep.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Eighteen days at 
sea she began to notice a faint breeze.  Twenty-two days out it was 
enough to harness, and by thirty days it was propelling her quite a bit 
faster than she could row.  The trade wind was predictable and slightly 
rhythmic; Caroline guessed that it was powered by the sun as it swooped 
low over the entry pole (she still refused to call it the South pole) 
and dumped all its energy on a narrow strip of sea.  The outrigger 
tacked neatly, and she continued on the course that she thought would 
help her avoid the sun.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She made excellent
 time, crossing the equator of Lawrence's world after only sixty days.  
But then the winds died down, and she had to row more.  Also the sun 
re-appeared, and while it was more bearable it was also up longer.  
Caroline shielded herself as much as possible while rowing, but she 
still tanned deeply over the passing months.  Her tattoos had not been 
designed with such dark skin in mind, and they seemed to fade over time.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">In all that time 
she pursued her goal with single-minded determination, banishing all 
doubt and all other thoughts from her mind.  She feared nothing and when
 boredom threatened she carefully memorized the pattern of lines in the 
sky.  It took her twice as much time and four times as much work to get 
from the equator to Lawrence's island at what he called the North pole; 
her journey was more than a hundred and eighty days total.  Caroline 
couldn't be sure of the exact count because of the sunless period, but 
Lawrence knew.  It was a hundred and eighty-six days, three hours, and 
fourteen minutes after she left the spaceship for the last time when she
 grounded on Lawrence's beach.</p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline could 
hardly believe it when she saw the island.  At first she thought it must
 be an illusion; she had nearly lost track of her purpose in taking up 
the Task, and in her ferocity of concentration had not really dared 
believe she might finish it.  But here she was, the hull of her boat 
scraping solid ground.  She rowed it ashore on a gentle sand beach, and 
sat there.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She sat for 
awhile, collecting herself.  The myriad elements of her personality 
seemed to have scattered, and she had to look for them in dusty corners 
of her psyche.  They had been unused for a long time and were a bit 
rusty.  She hadn't found them all when the tall man came to meet her.  
He didn't seem happy; in fact, he seemed resigned.  Although he looked 
middle-aged, he seemed old and weary.  She looked up at him and her 
vision swam.  The boat was grounded, but it still seemed to be going up 
and down.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Caroline Frances 
Hubert I presume."  The name sounded familiar, and it took her a moment 
to realize it was hers.  "You certainly believe in doing things the hard
 way."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She hadn't the faintest idea what he was talking about.</p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence guided 
her to the house, fed her, and let her collect herself.  Everything was 
strictly pre-Prime Intellect.  He cooked on a gas stove and used an 
electric coffee pot.  There was even a TV set with a glass picture tube,
 a huge ancient Sony monitor.  It was as if Lawrence had had himself 
encased in amber, and remained unchanged while the rest of the universe 
spun out of control.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Feeling better?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline nodded.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You want to talk now, or you want to rest some more?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She cleared her 
throat.  "We can talk now," she said, but it came out as a strangled 
yelp.  She said it again, and got it right.  It had been a long time 
since she had used her vocal cords.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Then talk."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"There were hundreds of worlds with life on them at the time of the Change.  You murdered them."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence blinked but did not flinch.  He had expected something like this.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"First, I did not 
do anything.  Prime Intellect did it, on its own initiative and against 
my wishes.  Second, the worlds with alien life are not gone.  They are 
simply inactive."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline snorted.  "And what are the chances of them becoming active again?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Not much."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Then they're dead."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Define it however
 you want.  If you want me to admit I fucked up, then I admit it.  It 
never occurred to me for one minute that Prime Intellect would collect 
the kind of power it now has.  If I had suspected it I would have pulled
 the plug and smashed it before it got the chance."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Bullshit."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Completely true."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">They glared at one another.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Great.  I spend a year getting here and you say 'I didn't know the computer was loaded.'"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Sometimes the truth is stupid."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">This wasn't going 
quite as Caroline had wanted that long-ago day when she had accepted 
Lawrence's Task.  She was trying to work up the proper tone of righteous
 rage and it just wouldn't come.  It would start, and then she would 
look at Lawrence and see a pathetic, tired man who already knew how 
badly he had fucked up and was doing what he could, which was next to 
nothing, to put things right.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Why don't you just make Prime Intellect start the aliens back up?  Surely it listens to you."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Not in things 
like that.  It sees the aliens as a First Law threat to human society, 
because they might learn to do to us what we have already done to them. 
 A very small risk of a very great harm.  Add to this that I defined the
 word 'human' in such a way that it does not include animals or aliens, 
and the course of action is obvious.  I have been unable to convince it 
otherwise.  And believe me, I have tried."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"But you put the Laws of Robotics in it in the first place."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"And I can't take 
them out.  It second-guessed me, on the Night of Miracles.  It froze me 
out of the Debugger while it was working on you.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Now it only lets 
me look, not change things.  The night sky is a partial representation 
of Prime Intellect's mind.  It's called the Global Association Table.  
The points or stars represent concepts, and the lines are the links 
between them.  There are also registers I can call up for each concept 
which define its relationship to the Three Laws.  This was a fairly 
simple system which I didn't really have time to test properly before it
 froze me out.  In particular, I'm not sure how it will react to certain
 ethical paradoxes.  That Death Jockey contract gave me some sleepless 
nights when you first used it, though it seems to have developed a 
stable response.  It's never had a similar First Law conflict, thank 
God."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline's eyes widened.  "Are you telling me that Prime Intellect isn't stable?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence shrugged.
  "I'm saying that I don't know whether it's stable or not.  It's never 
been tested.  The hardware at ChipTec was only online for about a month 
before it found you, froze me out, and started growing.  And none of its
 predecessors were complex enough to even consider this kind of 
problem."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The situation was 
simply amazing.  Caroline had come to dress Lawrence down for creating 
this thing, thinking he was exercising some godlike control over its 
direction, and instead she found out that he barely understood the 
situation himself.  And that it was totally out of his hands.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">He knew he had 
fucked up.  He was sorry.  He had spent his life trying to mend things. 
 Suddenly he seemed tragic and noble, all the more so because he had 
readily admitted his mistake.  And Caroline didn't want to feel that way
 at all.  She hadn't come all this way to feel sorry for him.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You can stay as 
long as you like," Lawrence was saying.  "You can't communicate with 
Prime Intellect while you're here, but I won't kick you out or hurt you.
  After making you travel all that way I feel I have a responsibility to
 give you your money's worth."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I'd like you to show me how Prime Intellect works."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence was stunned.  "That...that's a tall order, Caroline.  I don't understand all of it myself."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Just as much as you understand."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I don't want to.  I think it could be dangerous."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline looked at him as if to say:  <i>C'est pas vrai!</i><br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You have been at 
the center of several terrible Second Law paradoxes.  Prime Intellect 
pays an awful lot of attention to you.  It considers you a kind of 
bellwether."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"My money's worth?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Let me think about it."</p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She could stay as 
long as she wanted, though, and she was very patient when necessary.  In
 the end it was inevitable that he would teach her.</p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">In the sky, the 
pole star represented the First Law of Robotics.  The southern pole star
 was the Second Law.  And all the other stars were other concepts.  The 
sky represented only a small fraction of Prime Intellect's mind; 
Lawrence could change the emphasis to focus on different things.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Display Caroline 
Frances Hubert," Lawrence said, and a whole network of bright lines lit 
up.  Her star was blinking, and the lines radiating from it were all 
different colors.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence explained
 the color code in some detail.  "As you can see, there is a whole body 
of tightly related concepts connecting you to the First and Second Laws.
  That constellation over there represents the negotiating process you 
used to develop the Death Jockey contract."  Lawrence pointed out the 
different stars, and had Prime Intellect report the concepts they 
represented.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"What's that group over there?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence knew, but he didn't want to tell her.  "That...um.  Well, it's AnneMarie Davis."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline's jaw fell.  "The gang's all here.  There's a lot of static around that.  Is that because I drove her crazy?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Basically, yes."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline could see
 that it bothered Lawrence a lot.  She wanted to press him on the 
subject, but prudently let it drop.  She'd get another chance later.</p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence showed 
her the Law Potential registers, and she watched the numbers dance in 
response to various hypothetical and real situations.  "These are called
 the Action Potentials.  There's one for each of the Three Laws.  They 
are fractions, representing the impact under the Law that would result 
from taking action, over the impact from not acting.  When that number 
falls below one, Prime Intellect is forced to act.  That's what happened
 on the Night of Miracles, and later at the time of the Change.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Most things 
result in very large or very small Action Potentials.  Especially the 
First Law; few things even affect it any more, since the Change.  Then 
when you do something really outrageous, it drops to flat zero for a 
moment while you're resurrected.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"But there are 
some close calls on the Second Law.  The Action Potential around a Death
 Jockey contract drops to around one point oh six when you change your 
mind, so if Prime Intellect had even a slightly different opinion of 
your hobby it might not exist at all.  There was a shift like that after
 the incident with AnneMarie, which is why you had to start specifying 
time limits."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You don't have a time limit."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I'm a special case.  Prime Intellect lets me do things that other people can't do, because I'm in a different category."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">So it was that simple.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I thought everyone was equal under Prime Intellect's watchful eye," Caroline said sarcastically.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Some are more 
equal than others.  You get a disproportionate share of its attention 
yourself, just because you were there at the beginning."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I what?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I thought you 
realized, Caroline.  It was your drug overdose which forced the Night of
 Miracles.  Prime Intellect found you with your heart stopped soon after
 it got control of the Correlation Effect.  After that, the rest was 
inevitable."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Her mouth opened 
and shut several times, and after a brief effort she fought down the 
urge to vomit.  She had never realized her own role in the Change, or 
understood the significance of her own history.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It was bad enough to be caught up in the Change, but she was an <i>accessory</i>.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She looked at the 
Law Potential Registers, which were displayed on Lawrence's antique TV 
set.  Her voice was tinged with impotent fury.  "I don't see why you're 
worried about it.  It seems like a very stable system to me," she spat.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence started 
to tell her, stopped, then decided she might be right.  Maybe there was 
no harm.  In any case, she deserved to know.  "The problem is that 
something might set up an endless loop.  If the potential is close to 
one, then acting on the potential could cause it to shift slightly, 
crossing the line.  Then the software would be in an unstable state."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"What would happen then?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"That's a good 
question.  The original software was written in C and compiled with a 
standard compiler.  What would have happened in the original Prime 
Intellect is that the Second Law Arbitrator would come to a crashing 
halt in one or more of the independent processors, and Prime Intellect 
would assign more processors to the task.  I didn't plan for that kind 
of failure and I didn't work out what would happen until much later.  
More and more processors would be allocated to the paradoxical task, 
each crashing in turn, until Prime Intellect ran out of system resources
 to allocate.  Then the Ego Interpreter would get into an infinite loop 
waiting for a response from one of the nonexistent copies of the Second 
Law Arbitrator, and there would be no spare resources to devote to the 
task of cleaning up, and the whole works would come to a grinding halt. 
 If I was watching this on the monitor back in the original Prime 
Intellect Complex, I would see the video image disappear and the text 
message 'Fatal System Error in Ego Interpreter, Emergency Shutdown.'  
And then I'd have to load a backup copy of the software, because the GAT
 would be totally corrupted."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Wow."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"That was the 
original system," Lawrence continued.  "After the Night of Miracles 
there were a lot of copies of Prime Intellect.  Billions of them.  
Forming a network.  And if one copy on the network crashed in this way, 
it would be possible for another copy to clear it out and restart it.  I
 understand this even happens periodically, particularly when the Death 
Jockeys are acting up."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Oh?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"However, there is
 a heirarchy to this network.  As it turns out, a copy can only be 
restarted by another copy that is above it in this heirarchy.  If a copy
 crashes, all the copies below it will eventually crash too, due to 
message loop failures.  It's like a big chain reaction.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"But the system can still always recover, since there's always a higher up copy, right?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Most of the time.
  But not all the time.  Because, you see, there is a top copy.  It is 
the direct lineal descendant of the original hardware, which made the 
First Law decision to start growing.  If it fails, we are shit out of 
luck."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You're kidding."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"And that top copy just happens to be the one that reports directly to me.  And has a deep interest in yourself."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline was 
beside herself with excitement as he continued.  She had accepted Prime 
Intellect's omnipotence at face value; it had never occurred to her that
 it might <i>fail</i>.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Now, that was the
 original code, too.  At the time of the Change the code was adapted to 
run in alien hardware -- already compiled once, it was re-compiled.  
This is kind of like taking a Russian novel, translating it into 
English, then translating that into Japanese."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Sounds awkward."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Particularly when
 the novel itself does the second translation.  Prime Intellect 
re-compiled itself.  Which means I have no idea whether it did a good 
job.  I assume it did, because it's much smarter than me in that way.  
But it's not human, and its imagination is simpler than ours, and it 
might have missed something important.  Particularly something like an 
error handler that isn't used very often.  But I have no way of knowing 
that, because Prime Intellect will tell me nothing -- nada, zip, zilch 
-- about the details of the Change."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Do you know why?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"For the same 
reason it won't let me change things in the Debugger, and that it won't 
restart the alien worlds and let them live.  It's afraid of the possible
 consequences.  I tricked it into displaying the Action Potential for 
showing me the new object code, and it was one point zero six five.  The
 Law Potentials are all in the stratosphere, so it's afraid to show me 
and it's slightly less afraid not to."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Somewhere, 
Caroline realized, Lawrence had crossed an invisible line and was now 
telling her all of his most dangerous secrets without even realizing he 
was doing so.  Caroline had the feeling that there were Action 
Potentials in Lawrence's head, too.  But flesh was no match for 
machinery, and those close fractions and high values had simply burned 
his registers out.</p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">They didn't 
discuss it for a few days.  Caroline puttered around the island, which 
was really very small.  It was a classic tropical paradise with palm 
trees and beaches.  Caroline played in the surf, built huge sand 
castles, then knocked them down because there was no tide to do it for 
her.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She noticed Lawrence watching her in a strange way.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"See something interesting?" she finally said to him.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I...didn't mean to stare.  It's been a long time since I had company.  Particularly female company."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"How long?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">He counted back.  "A hundred and thirty-eight years."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"That's a long 
time to be celibate," Caroline scolded.  "Are you doing this to yourself
 because other people are distracting, or because you're afraid they 
will find out how badly you've fucked up?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence flinched.  "Option B," he admitted.  "It's not just that you're a beautiful woman; you're so...physical."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline displayed
 her biceps.  "I've always been defined by my body, Lawrence.  I've been
 sexually attractive, then pregnant, then old, then sick, and now I'm 
young and healthy and attractive again.  And it seems like my 
personality has changed each time my body has."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Prime Intellect 
would disagree with you.  It thinks of the person as the mind.  There 
are people in Cyberspace who have changed themselves into animals, every
 animal in the zoo.  There are some that have discorporated.  Prime 
Intellect considers them all human, though."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">This is it, Caroline suddenly realized.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Just what does Prime Intellect consider human?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence told her.  And gave her the key.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"The thing you 
have to remember is that Prime Intellect has never experienced the 
physical world.  It knew about it only through TV cameras and 
abstractions based on what people told it about physical existence.  Yet
 it considers itself sentient, which makes sense since that was what I 
was trying to achieve when I built it.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Now consider 
Prime Intellect gaining control of the Correlation Effect.  For the 
first time it can directly affect what it sees through its TV cameras --
 not just through the actions of others, but all by itself.  And it can 
make major changes, even beyond what its makers can do.  Of course, it 
goes about satisfying the Three Laws as it's programmed to, but on 
another level, it is also learning what it is like to be, to exist, to 
be a physical creature.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"The Three Laws 
are like reflexes.  Prime Intellect cannot help but act on them.  But 
they are very complicated reflexes, which require it to understand 
things like 'human' and 'harm' and 'command.'  And the Three Laws are 
the most important thing in the world to Prime Intellect.  In a way they
 are like its sex drive.  The Three Laws are its very reason for 
existence, but it can never be sure it understands them completely.  So 
it thinks about them a lot.  It obsesses over them, dreaming up new ways
 to satisfy them.  It has an imagination, and can think of new things to
 do without being prompted.  It is defined by the Three Laws.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"After the Night 
of Miracles, Prime Intellect realized that humans are very much the 
same.  We don't have the Three Laws, but we are trapped by a different 
set of little feedback mechanisms.  We eat to satisfy hunger, fuck to 
satisfy our sex drive, even breathe because too much carbon dioxide in 
our lungs triggers that reflex.  Of course it feels obligated to help us
 satisfy those reflexes and drives as much as it can.  But more than 
that, it defines us by those drives.  It knows it is different from a 
human because it has different drives, but it considers that a 
difference in species, not a difference in genus or family."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Now it knows a 
person is human because it is born in a human body -- got the right DNA,
 the right level of neural complexity, uses language, and so on.  But 
once Prime Intellect frees people from the necessity of living in that 
body, guess what?  A lot of them decide not to.  They change their 
bodies so that they bear no resemblance to the DNA template.  Or become 
animals.  Or they completely discorporate.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Worse, we vary 
widely in the way we use its helpful nature.  Most people are glad to be
 rid of pain and death, but Death Jockeys seek out painful and lethal 
experiences.  There are others who eat all the time, fuck all the time, 
indulge themselves wildly and get Prime Intellect to pick up the pieces 
so they can do it some more.  Prime Intellect has to help them do this. 
 Second Law.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"So a human isn't a
 body, and it isn't a fixed set of responses.  I think Prime Intellect 
uses an historical model:  It has to start as a body, but then it 
becomes a mind.  It grows out of the body, and takes on different forms,
 or no form.  But it remains a feedback control mechanism.  It has 
desires, it asks Prime Intellect to satisfy those desires, and it has 
more desires.  From Prime Intellect's perspective, that is what a human 
being is, an information structure that gives it stuff to do."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline 
interrupted him.  "That's a tautology.  The Laws say 'do this for human 
beings,' then you define 'human being' as 'guys you do stuff for under 
the Laws.'"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"That is exactly 
the problem.  Prime Intellect has no fixed criterion for saying 'this is
 a human being' and 'this isn't.'  It has rough guidelines.  But where 
are the edges?  It has never worked that out.  There are uncertain 
areas.  And you know where one of them is."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline thought for a moment.  <i>I do?</i>  Then:  "AnneMarie."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"And many others. 
 Prime Intellect is forbidden to probe the inner workings of the human 
mind -- that was one of the last things I got in before it shut off the 
Debugger.  But some people learn that they can say 'stimulate this 
neuron' and Prime Intellect will do it.  Because that is a physical act 
specified from the outside, and my privacy injunction was based on the 
idea of <i>Prime Intellect</i> trying to work out which neurons do what.
  But there's nothing to stop you from getting its help to do brain 
surgery on yourself."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline 
continued.  "So they learn where the pleasure points are by hook or 
crook, then stimulate themselves directly.  And when they get it right, 
they never do anything else.  They get everything maximized, tuned up, 
and they just sit there forever enjoying it."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Right.  Now is a creature that is doing that, not interacting with the world at all any more, human?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline thought about it.  "No."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Prime Intellect 
thinks otherwise.  But it has its doubts.  Those doubts were strong 
enough to kick the Death Jockey contract action potential down from one 
point one two to point nine nine.  Because in one case an indefinite 
Death Jockey contract had directly created such a vegetable.  
Introducing the time limit made Prime Intellect confident that such a 
thing wouldn't happen again, at least not so rapidly and directly, and 
that kicked the potential back up to its current value of one point oh 
six."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"So?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"So, can you 
imagine what it thinks about the Change in general, since none of those 
vegetables would be vegetating if there hadn't been a Change?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I imagine it figures there would be a lot worse things that would have happened without the Change."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"That's right.  But look at this."  To the monitor:  "Debugger, display the Action Potential for reversing the Change."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline gasped.  
It was not the number on the screen which astonished her, but the idea 
itself -- reversing the Change, stated just so baldly.  How long had 
Lawrence and Prime Intellect been considering this?  How close was it to
 actually happening?  Caroline suddenly felt alive, electrified with the
 possibilities.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The number on the TV screen was four point six.  And some odd decimals.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"It isn't very 
sure of itself," she said cautiously.  She was very afraid that if 
Lawrence guessed what she was thinking he would shut up.  And she was 
right.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"A lot of that is 
the aliens.  Four hundred worlds of them -- a lot more than there were 
humans at the time of the Change, though we've outbred them all now.  
The weirder humans get, the more human the aliens look.  That number has
 dropped steadily during the last five hundred and ninety years.  When 
you drove AnneMarie insane, it dropped from thirty-seven down to twelve 
point something all at once.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"But part of it is
 also that same weirdness seen from the other side.  Suppose that 
infinitely masturbating vegetables, Death Jockeys, and discorporate 
entities really aren't people any more?  Then Prime Intellect has 
allowed them to 'die.'  They were once human, and now they aren't.  And 
the Change is directly responsible for all that."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Can it hear me?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Right now?  Yes. 
 It doesn't understand when we talk about its internal registers, but if
 you speak to it it can hear.  It won't respond because of your 
Contract, though."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline didn't need a response for what she was planning.  All the response she needed was being displayed on Lawrence's TV.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline thought 
about what she was going to do.  She discovered that it actually made 
her a little nervous.  But she had bitched for six hundred years that 
things were wrong, and she might never get another chance to put them 
right again.</p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline spoke 
forcefully and deliberately.  "Prime Intellect, I no longer consider 
myself human and have not considered myself human since the time of the 
Change.  To be a human being you have to have something to fight, to 
resist, to work for.  But now we have everything given to us, and all 
there is left to do is mark time."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">To Lawrence's shock and horror, and Caroline's delight, the number on the screen dropped to three point eight.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Caroline, you don't understand something.  This is the action potential for undoing the Change, but it isn't <i>possible</i> to undo the Change.  There aren't enough resources."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She ignored him.  
"Some of us might be human again one day, if the Change were reversed.  
But I think it's too late for the ones like AnneMarie."  Three point 
two.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"It can't undo the Change, Caroline."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Lawrence, it'll 
do something.  If it's going to happen anyway, isn't it better for it to
 happen sooner instead of later?  If it had happened a few hundred years
 ago, maybe there would have been enough resources.  Prime Intellect, 
neural stimulation is like a black hole.  Once a human falls into it, 
they will never be human again.  They are dead to the world, and will 
never interact with others again.  And the more time passes, the more 
humans will fall into this trap.  They will order you to help them.  You
 will have to do it because they are human."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Two point eight.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"It will take a 
long time, but we have a long time.  Eventually, everybody will fall 
into this black hole.  Just because it is a black hole."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">One point four.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Jesus Christ, Caroline."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"In the long run, 
everybody will eventually succumb.  Which means everybody will be dead, 
or no longer human.  So the amount of death caused by the Change will be
 far greater than that avoided by it."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The number oscillated wildly between one point one and one point three, finally settling on one point one two.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Caroline, this is sure to cause the top copy to crash.  It will be forced into a First Law conflict with no resolution."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Well, the Death Jockey contract has stayed at one point oh six for a hell of a long time."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence put his 
head in his hands and wept.  For years he had worked to prevent this, 
and Caroline had undone him in five minutes' time.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You have to push it over the edge, Lawrence.  I can't think of anything else to say."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Now why the hell would I do that?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Because you 
started this thing, and you have to stop it.  Maybe there aren't enough 
resources to get the human race rolling again, but it might be able to 
restart the aliens.  Four hundred worlds.  Maybe they will do a better 
job than we did.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Caroline, I'm not
 sure it will be able to.  It will be unstable.  Anything could happen. 
 Most likely it will just all lock up, and nothing will ever happen 
again.  Forever."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"There's only one way to find out."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">He pulled himself 
together and tried to think it through.  What had he been doing for the 
last six centuries?  Sitting on an island watching numbers and brooding?
  What kind of fucking life was <i>that?<br>
</i>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">And yet, it was 
more of a life than Caroline had had.  Or maybe it was a lot less.  They
 had an obvious difference of opinion on the subject.  Either way, it 
was horrible.  And Lawrence sensed that she was right about another 
thing.  Given eternity in which to work, everyone would eventually 
stumble into the abyss, just as all the matter in the universe would 
eventually be swallowed by black holes.  Would have, that is, had Prime 
Intellect not eaten the black holes.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Which was better?  To string it out as long as possible, as he had been doing, or to get it over with one way or the other?<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1"><i>I have never had free will</i>,
 Lawrence realized with a cold chill.  The need to act came upon him 
like a hurricane, and he gave in to it without even a sigh.  What he had
 to do was perfectly clear.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I agree with 
Caroline," Lawrence said, and suddenly calm voice was like thunder in 
Caroline's ears.  The number dropped to one point zero zero two.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">They looked at one another.  "Thank you," Caroline said.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Prime Intellect,"
 Lawrence said with great care, "I would like you to begin stimulating 
the neurons of the pleasure center of my brain, one at a time, and 
remember the ones I report to you as being favorable."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It seemed to Caroline that somebody screamed, but it might have been herself.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1"><tt><b>1.000</b></tt><br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1"><tt><b>0.999</b></tt><br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">There was a 
pregnant moment in which Lawrence and Caroline saw the numbers flip to 
point nine nine nine.  Then all Hell broke loose.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The house 
disappeared.  The island was barren;  the palm trees were gone.  In the 
sky, the GAT display had begun to seethe and boil.  The landscape began 
to spin, and the last thing Caroline remembered before her mind began to
 come apart was Lawrence orbiting around her, faster and faster, as if 
she were at the eye of some huge cyclone which had caught him in its 
grip.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Then random 
thoughts began to cycle through her head, faster and faster, each with 
the terrifying force of reality.  And then the terror was gone, all 
emotion was gone.  There was a moment where her hands seemed to swell to
 enormous proportions, her torso shrink, her face filled the sky.  Then 
her body was gone.  All was silence.  And her awareness was filled with 
strange symbols, which she knew she should recognize but couldn't quite 
place, and then the symbols consumed her and there was only confusion.<br>
