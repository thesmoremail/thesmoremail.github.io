<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Her name was Caroline Frances Hubert, and she had three claims to fame.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">In the first 
place she was the thirty-seventh oldest living human being.  Caroline 
herself was unimpressed by this fact.  To her way of thinking it was the
 result of an accident, nothing more.  In any case she had been the 
thirty-seventh oldest human being for a long, long time, and it got to 
seem more of a bore than an accomplishment after a while.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">In the second 
place she had once been infected with rabies.  Caroline was rather proud
 of this distinction, though it had also been a long time ago.  There 
was a certain class of people who were quite impressed with Caroline's 
bout with rabies, not so much because she survived it but because she <i>hadn't</i>.
  It had taken Prime Intellect fifty-six hours to realize it couldn't 
repair the damage to her nervous system, to backtrack, and to put her 
together again like Humpty Dumpty.  For fifty-six hours, she had not 
existed.  She had been dead.  And she was the only one of the trillions 
of souls in Cyberspace who had ever been dead, even for a little while.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">In the third 
place, and most important to Caroline because it represented a real 
accomplishment rather than an accident or a one-shot stab of cleverness,
 she was undisputed Queen of the Death Jockeys.  She would always be the
 thirty-seventh oldest person, and after her rabies experiment Prime 
Intellect had shut the door on further explorations of that nature.  But
 the Death Jockeys constantly rated and ranked themselves by 
inventiveness and daring and many other factors.  It was an ongoing 
competition, and if Caroline didn't keep working at it she'd be lost in 
an always-growing crowd of contenders.  Caroline wouldn't admit that her
 high ranking was important to her, but it was all she had and she threw
 herself at it with an energy that was fierce and sometimes startling.</p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">As she woke up, a
 window opened up in front of her, a perfect square of light, 
razor-edged and opaque.  One cold message floated within it:

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She could have 
had any surroundings she wanted, even a whole planet of her own design. 
 A waste of time, she felt.  Her personal space was minimal.  In fact, 
it was the <i>bare</i> minimum, a floor and a gravity field.  There was 
no visual distinction between the floor and the sky or ceiling or 
whatever you chose to call it.  Everything was exactly the same shade of
 soft white.  When she wanted to relax she turned off the gravity and 
floated in free-fall.  When she wanted to sleep, she turned off the 
light.  If she wanted anything else, she called for it and then got rid 
of it when she was finished.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Gravity.  
Keyboard," she demanded.  She felt gradually increasing pressure under 
her feet as a console blinked into existence.  Caroline was as 
conservative as her years -- six hundred and ninety of them -- might 
suggest, a collector of useless skills and worthless experiences.  
Typing was one of the useless skills she prized most highly, and her 
fingers flew rapidly as she discussed the day's business with the 
Supreme Being:

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline 
scowled.  None of them even pre-Change -- Prime Intellect would have 
noted it if they were.  Babes hoping to get lucky and impress her.  The 
third one was interesting, though; he must have done something 
noteworthy to garner a 9 rating in so many exhibitions.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline 
blinked.  It was hard for her to understand the souls who continued to 
feel a need, even after hundreds of years, to be fruitful and multiply. 
 Actually encountering someone so young made her feel a little creepy.  
Calculating backward, she wondered what manner of psychotic would have 
bothered to have a child after 568 years of Cyberlife.

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Prime Intellect 
didn't reply; it had learned that the best response to her jabs was to 
ignore them.  It had long ago given up trying to reform her.  She knew 
it did not like Death Jockeys one little bit, if a computer could even 
be said to "like" or "dislike" anything.  And in Caroline's case the 
feeling was certainly mutual.<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">  In her fantasies, she dreamed of having the power to give it a case of heartburn so big its gears would stop turning.<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Most people did 
not share Caroline's distaste for the Omniscient One.  A great many 
worshipped it, despite its apparent embarrassment over the fact.  But 
why not?  It could and would do damn near anything you asked, as long as
 it didn't affect anyone else.  And even that was open to negotiation 
with the other people you might want to involve.  There were no 
noticeable limits to its power and it never asked why.  Caroline knew a 
whole crowd of people who preferred for Prime Intellect to manifest 
itself in the form of an attractive member of the opposite sex.  Prime 
Intellect was nothing less than the perfect God, made incarnate by the 
power of technology.  Caroline couldn't see how fucking God was less 
perverted than being death-obsessed, but hey, there it was.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline hadn't 
been all that impressed with God even in the days before Lawrence had 
brought it forth in his own image.  She preferred to keep it in its 
place.  It was just a computer.  If you didn't keep that thought <i>firmly</i>
 in your mind it was too easy to start thinking of it as human, and that
 was the first step toward forgetting.  Caroline didn't want to forget. 
 And she didn't need to fuck Prime Intellect to get her jollies anyway. 
 She could get her jollies from actual people.  She only communicated 
with it at all when she had to, through the screen, keyboard, and a few 
curt spoken and subvocal commands.<br>

</b></p><p> 

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Instantly, her surroundings changed. </p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She was standing
 in the middle of a circle of people in an open meadow.  Earthlike.  
With fourteen trillion people running around Cyberspace, you'd think a 
few of them would come up with something more imaginative than carbon 
copies of the Earth.  <i>Poor quality</i> carbon copies at that, natch.  There was a big hole in the ground, perhaps ten feet wide, at her feet.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">A tall, 
youthfully handsome man stood across it from her, impeccably dressed and
 groomed.  This was a bad sign, because appearances were cheap in 
Cyberspace.  All it took was a word, and you could be young or old or 
thin or have different hair.  You could change sex or race or even make 
yourself into an animal.  Nobody was impressed by appearances any more. 
 Nobody, at least, except for those of her generation who remembered 
what it was to be insecure, and the very young who hadn't figured out 
the score yet.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline let her
 own body age naturally; when she reached her apparent late thirties, 
she had it restored to about age sixteen.  This wasn't vanity; she 
couldn't maintain her athletic lifestyle if she allowed herself to get 
too old.  She had been through the cycle dozens of times.  Most people 
simply had themselves frozen at an age they found comfortable and left 
it at that, but Caroline preferred the occasional dramatic intervention.
  The first time she had regressed she hadn't been asked, and doing it 
this way helped remind her of that violation.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">At the moment 
Caroline looked to be in her mid to late twenties.  Her athletic build 
was the result of real exercise, her skills the result of real practice.
  She asked Prime Intellect for very little, and resented having to ask 
for that.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline was 
naked.  She had not worn clothes since the Change except for an 
occasional costume in a Death fantasy.  She wore no makeup, and her long
 hair was an unkempt tangle.  What was the point?  A word to Prime 
Intellect could provide anything, fix anything, but none of those things
 it provided or fixed would be uniquely <i>hers</i>.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Which didn't 
mean Caroline refused to decorate her body at all.  It just meant that 
she decorated it in signature style, without help from Prime Intellect.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Welcome," he said.  "I am Timothy.  You are Caroline Hubert?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"The one and only."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"An honor, then.  And it is an honor for me to challenge you to accept Authentic Death."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Proceed," Caroline mumbled.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline looked around at the audience, and noticed that they were <i>all</i>
 wearing clothes.  Worse, they were all wearing the same kind of 
clothes, casual dress that would not have been out of place in a Western
 city just before the Change.  That was an even stronger sign she was in
 amateur territory.  Caroline's aesceticism may have been extreme, but 
she was hardly alone in her belief that clothing was pointless for 
immortals.  Any random grouping of people would normally include some 
pretty wide variations in fashion.  Especially at Death exhibitions, 
which tended to attract loons and deviants like herself.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She felt an 
instant dislike for this kid.  True, she felt an instant dislike for 
nearly anybody who participated in the sham that passed for reality in 
Cyberspace, but in Timothy's case the feeling was stronger than usual.  
This hate welled up within her unbidden like those other mysterious and 
powerful feelings, love and masochism and sexual attraction.  He had a 
kind of natural charisma, and she could feel the small crowd orbiting 
around him.  Females outnumbered the males by more than two to one.  He 
probably had them all convinced he was a fucking genius, as if genius 
was a rare commodity in Cyberspace or as if it had anything to do.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">They were 
anxious, though.  Anxious in the presence of the great lady, anxious to 
see how their little tin genius would fare.  They were unnerved by her 
nakedness, by her proud and alert stance, by her forthrightness and lack
 of self-consciousness.  They sensed that their clothing could not 
protect them from her scorn, nor would her nakedness make her vulnerable
 to theirs.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Most of all, though, they were unnerved by the fact that she wasn't <i>quite</i> naked.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline's body 
was covered with brightly colored pictures, pictures that had obviously 
been there a long time.  Pictures that didn't come off.  The pictures 
were even worse than simple nakedness, because they drew the eye to the 
very parts of Caroline's body that would normally be covered and 
private.  Timothy coughed and posed the question that was obviously on 
all of their minds:  "Your body decorations are fascinating.  Are they 
Authentic?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Tattoos."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I understand the process is painful."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She flexed her arm, regarding the fat python coiled around it.  Painful?  <i>Especially</i>
 the way she got them, it was painful.  She was covered in serpents, and
 with one exception every design had been drawn with an obsidian knife 
blade and colored by rubbing natural pigments into the cuts.  They 
covered eighty percent of her body.  Even her face was framed by a pair 
of green mambas.  Snakes slithered up and down her torso, coiled about 
her limbs, investigated her orifices.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The one 
exception was a tiny black design on her left shin; that one wasn't a 
snake and it wasn't a tattoo.  It was the letter "F" and it was the 
signature of her tattoo artist.  It had been applied with a branding 
iron.  The memories made her smile; new tattoos were the only good thing
 about her periodic age regressions.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"It doesn't kill you," she finally said.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Nervous laughter.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"All you have to do is jump in," Timothy suggested.  "After making the Contract, of course."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"It's a designed experience, is that it?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Yes."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"How long you spent designing it?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Two years.  I've gone through twenty-three times myself."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline nodded, sighed, and said:  "Prime Intellect, standard Death Contract for...is twelve hours enough?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"It should be," Timothy said.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Standard 
Contract for twelve hours."  She felt the warning buzz that meant it had
 heard; then disconnect.  The always-present listening ear, or 
microphone, was gone.  It would obey her last command perfectly -- until
 it was countermanded by Timothy, whose universe it was, or by her own 
impending demise, which would kick in the First Law.  Or until twelve 
hours had passed, in the unlikely event she survived that long.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">No matter what happened, she would have no trouble making Raven's party.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She jumped.</p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She fell about 
ten meters and landed on her feet, breaking her left leg below the knee.
  That was no big deal; had she landed on one of the spikes which dotted
 the bottom of the hole, she'd already be impaled.  She wondered what 
would happen next if she had; impaling is cute but it hardly qualifies 
as a grade-nine experience.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It was dark.  
Very Freudian; she should have expected that from a Catholic kid, no 
matter how rebellious he thought he was.  They'd be watching her with 
enhanced senses, though.  Timothy wasn't the sort to extend Authenticity
 to the observation process.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Well, it was his universe.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She was at one 
end of a tunnel.  It was dolled up to look like a natural cave, but 
Caroline knew right away that there was nothing natural about it.  Real 
caves do not grow in nice neat lines.  They twist.  They tend to follow 
the soft rocks, which occur in sheets and often aren't level.  The hole 
she had fallen through should have been a sinkhole; she should be 
surrounded by fallen rocks and debris.  But it was as straight and solid
 as an elevator shaft.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">This space had <i>none</i>
 of the defining qualities of a natural cave.  It was just a rough 
tunnel, carved by Timothy's imagination.  He had thought to hang 
stalactites from the tunnel ceiling, even though there were no other 
cave formations to suggest how they were formed, and no matching 
stalagmites projecting from the flat, dry floor.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She began 
crawling down the tunnel, and the first stalactite fell inches from her 
side.  It shattered; it was not stone but some glasslike material that 
revealed thousands of razor-sharp edges.  Another fell some distance 
away.  Great, she thought idly.  She crawled on, collecting hundreds of 
small cuts from the shards.  Then one fell on her left hand directly, 
skewering it.  Caroline gasped, but she didn't scream.  She just broke 
it off and kept going.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She wondered if he was aiming them, or if the fall was random.  It didn't really matter; the idea wasn't to survive, after all.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She reached the 
end of the tunnel, and found herself in a small chamber.  Another tunnel
 veered off to the right at a sharp angle.  How imaginative.  A glowing 
ball hung by a thread from the ceiling.  She raised her hand toward the 
light and watched in astonishment as her fingers sheared off in a 
perfect line.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Whafuck?" she 
said aloud.  She moved her hand again, and sliced off more flesh.  An 
invisible cutting surface was stretched across the room.  The pain was 
beginning to get interesting, but not interesting enough to counteract 
her growing sense of boredom.  Blood was jetting from the stumps of her 
fingers.  Summoning her strength, she aimed carefully and sat up, 
deliberately decapitating herself.<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She was conscious of her own head falling, striking the floor as her body twitched above, and then Prime Intellect intervened.<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Why the hell 
did you do that?" Timothy demanded from across the entry pit.  She had 
snapped back whole, as if she had never jumped.  She could still feel a 
little pain where her leg had broken, just a fading echo.  Fading fast.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"If you had designed it right, I wouldn't have been <i>able</i> to do that.  What the hell was that cutter supposed to be, anyway?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"That was diamond monofilament.  Part of the booby trap you were <i>supposed</i> to get past, minus a few more dents.  If you..."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You call that <i>Authentic?</i>"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"It's physically possible..."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"No it's <i>not</i>.
  This is science-fiction shit.  What were those stalactites made of?  I
 can tell you it wasn't calcium carbonate.  Look, you want to compete in
 Pain, or Adventure, or Imagination, go right ahead.  But Authentic is 
for things that could really have happened in the pre-Change world."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I don't think you understand..."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I don't think <i>you</i> understand, sonny.  Did you bother to ask Prime Intellect about me?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You're pre-Change and you're the best.  That's what counts."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Not just pre-Change.  I was a hundred and six years old.  <i>Before</i>
 the Change.  I was in a nursing home with bedsores the size of 
baseballs and six different kinds of cancer eating me away.  And my 
nurse was stealing my pain medication to trade for cocaine, so I got to 
experience every delightful moment in full three-D.  This went on for <i>years</i>.
  And I didn't know Prime Intellect was gonna pop me back into this nice
 healthy body when it was all over.  It was just the inky unknown and 
the pain.  That's what death is.  <i>That's</i> what counts."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I was just trying to reach an artistic balance," he pouted.  "I didn't realize you'd be so picky about the technical details."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"<i>Artistic?</i>  What fucking <i>bullshit!</i>  You think I've never been chopped into little bitty bits before?  You just don't have time to appreciate <i>art</i> in a situation like that.  Not if you have any human feelings at all."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Why not?  It's just a game."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"That is exactly the problem."  She signalled Prime Intellect, and the meadow disappeared.</p><p>


<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You really put him in his place."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The words came 
from a shambling monster, a skeleton with loose folds of rotting flesh 
draped across its bones.  Although its muscles couldn't possibly work, 
it moved, pointing a bony finger at her.  The jaw moved as it talked, 
and sound came out even though the larynx and lungs had long rotted 
away.  Its voice was strong and powerful.  Surprisingly bright and alert
 eyes bobbed in the eye sockets.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You're starting to stink, Fred."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I know.  I think it adds an extra dimension to the experience.  You wouldn't <i>believe</i> how many types of bacteria are involved in the decay process."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Fred was on his 
seventh body as a zombie; when all the scraps of flesh rotted away and 
he was reduced to a living skeleton, he'd have it fleshed out again and 
start the process over.  He had directed Prime Intellect to change the 
rules slightly in his personal space; death was still impossible, but 
healing occurred only in the authentic circumstances at the authentic 
rate.  When healing was impossible, as it was after each time Fred cut 
his wrists to extinguish the life of his new body, consciousness and 
feeling would go on.  Even for a rotting corpse.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It had started out as nothing more than a little joke on Caroline's periodic un-aging ritual, but Fred had found that it was <i>fun</i> to be a zombie.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">His personal 
home was decorated in a matching Halloween motif; he had a huge haunted 
house with rotting floorboards and real ghosts.  Large spiders spun 
intricate webs in the corners.  Monsters prowled outside in the 
graveyard.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"That punk needed his bubble popped.  He should spend some time as a zombie.  Might teach him something."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"He never will.  Too vain."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Never is a long time," he reminded her.<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">There was a dramatic ding, followed several seconds later by a long, sonorous dong.  A kid's voice: "Trick or treat!"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Care to get the door, darling?" Fred asked graciously.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline laughed
 and got up.  Fred faded away.  She knew the "kid" would be nearly as 
old as herself.  Prime Intellect would never allow a real child anywhere
 near Fred.  But Caroline wasn't the only one to appreciate his twisted 
and darkly humorous fantasies.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She opened the 
door and juvenile eyes opened wide in startled amazement.  "Lady, you're
 naked!" the brat said.  He looked about twelve, and was a surprisingly 
good actor.  It was easy to believe his dumbfounded gape was the 
reaction of a pubescent boy who had never seen a naked woman before.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"No I'm not," Caroline said sweetly.  I have my beautiful tattoos."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I...I..."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You want a 
treat?" Caroline asked teasingly, cupping her breasts and offering them 
to him.  Her left nipple was already being tasted by a tattooed snake, 
whose body was coiled around her right breast, framing it invitingly.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"My...my mama said..."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Or you want the <i>trick?</i>"
  Fred floated down from the roof and wrapped one rotting hand around 
the kid's head, forcing him forward, mashing his face against her bosom.
  "Take a <i>close</i> look," he said.  "Take your <i>last</i> look."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The kid began 
screeching quite realistically, then Fred dragged him inside and started
 taking him apart.  He should have gone into shock after Fred ripped off
 his right arm, but that little physiological mechanism also didn't work
 in Fred's home.  Fred took a couple of experimental bites, then tossed 
the arm aside.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Stringy," Fred said.  "Let's try a drumstick."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The screams 
reached ear-piercing levels as Fred ripped off the left leg.  There was 
blood everywhere, but Fred was working fast and the kid wouldn't have 
time to bleed to death.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Want a bite?" he asked Caroline.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Thanks, I already ate," Caroline said politely.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Fred the Zombie 
ripped the boy's belly open and rooted in his intestines, then gutted 
him.  Finally he administered what should have been the coup de grace by
 ripping the kid's head off.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Fred held it up 
by the hair and pressed the face against Caroline's breasts.  "One last 
kiss," he directed.  The eyes were still tracking, and the mouth trying 
to scream.  Then it kissed her left nipple, touching its blue tongue to 
the forked tongue of the tattoo-snake as Fred had directed it to.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Bye now," he said to the head, and he dropped it and smashed it underfoot.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Do these guys really get off on this?" Caroline asked.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"This question coming from a woman who infected herself with <i>rabies</i>,
 no less."  The body, including the spreading stain of blood and gore, 
disappeared.  "Nearly all of them are pre-Change.  You saw an example of
 a <i>modern</i> sex pervert just before your arrival here."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Ugh.  Give me Charlie Manson.  Someone with class."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"At your service."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Debate had raged
 just after the Change over people like Fred, the serial killers and 
pedophiles and rapists that were running around when things got made 
over.  There was a huge demand for them to be eliminated, or punished.  
Prime Intellect had stood its ground, saying that it was no longer 
possible for them to hurt anyone and there wasn't any point.  This had 
made it seem terribly moral, although Caroline thought the real reason 
Prime Intellect reacted that way was that Lawrence had fucked up its 
programming.  But it had been a little late to do anything about that.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You didn't pop over to check out the guilt-ridden pedophiles," Fred said.  "You want to play?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She shrugged.  
"Beats farting around with Timothy."  She steeled herself.  "Standard 
Contract until the party," she then said to the thin air.  There was no 
need to tell Prime Intellect what kind of Contract she meant.  She 
played with Fred often enough that it knew exactly what she wanted.  She
 felt the buzz, then the disconnect, as it cut off contact.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Now I have you," Fred said.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"First you have 
to catch me," Caroline said playfully, and she ran.  She made it out the
 front door before Fred could react.  But she was limited to ordinary 
human movements, while Fred had the controls to local reality.  He 
simply flew after her and caught her neck in an iron grip.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline swung 
at him but she couldn't connect.  He held her at arm's length, slightly 
off the ground.  She gripped his arm and tried to pry his bony fingers 
from her throat.  He tightened his grip and she started to gasp.  
Tightened some more, and she began to tremble and turn purple.  He 
played with her for a few minutes, choking her very slowly.  Finally she
 had no more strength to fight and he loosened his grip slightly.  Then 
he dragged her back to the house and carried her upstairs to the master 
bedroom.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She flickered in
 and out of consciousness; when lucidity finally returned, she was 
spread-eagled on her back on Fred's bed.  It stank of Fred and mildew, 
and things crawled beneath her in the mattress.  But rotten as they 
appeared, the four massive posts were solid within, and the chains which
 held her were cold and unforgiving.  A thin trickle of water ran down 
the wall behind her.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">For a brief 
moment she felt an irrational but wholly understandable surge of love 
for Fred.  His life might read like a catalogue of torture, but there 
were certain things which he considered special, that he would not share
 with just anybody.  His most cherished memories from the real times 
before the Change were of victims securely bound as Caroline was now 
bound, spread-eagled on their backs, their young bodies stretched and 
their naked bellies vulnerable as he prepared a long, memorable ending 
for their otherwise meaningless lives.  Caroline was one of the few he 
trusted to be worthy of those memories, to share in the (to him) 
beautiful thing he had created so many hundreds of years ago, when it 
was still possible.  It was as close to a declaration of true love as 
she could ever expect to get from such a psychopath.  And because she 
respected Fred more than anyone else in Cyberspace, it made her feel 
appreciated and special.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It did not make 
her feel warm.  She was, after all, helpless, and being worthy of Fred's
 affection meant she would be worthy of a long, subtle, and agonizing 
torture.  Even though she had asked for it, she had room to fear what 
was about to happen to her.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It was always 
cool in Fred's house -- always Halloween, which occurs at nighttime in 
the autumn.  But now it was chilly, too chilly to be naked.   Fred the 
Zombie came for her, and she allowed herself a scream to please him.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">His rotting 
fingers probed her cunt.  Every touch set her on fire, partly (but not 
entirely) because he was using his power to control her hormones and 
tickle her neurotransmitters, forcing her to become sexually excited.  
It was a delicate process that could easily be carried too far, ruining 
the effect.  But Fred was a very careful, if repulsive, lover.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">He grinned at 
her -- could do nothing else, really, since hardly anything was left of 
his face except the skull itself.  His alert eyes savored her 
helplessness.  He leaned over the bed, over her.  He gripped her head 
and kissed her, nearly choking her with his stink, teeth and bone 
against her lips.  Then she felt herself gripping the finger in her 
cunt, gripping the bone.  The throbbing spread through her body, and the
 shambling thing emitted an evil laugh.  She heard herself screaming as 
the carefuly amplified orgasm ripped through her brain.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Fred traced the 
outline of her throat with the sharp tip of a finger bone.  "Join me 
love," he said softly.  Caroline was still shaking from the force of her
 orgasm when she felt the adrenaline being pumped into her system.  
Pleasure yielded to fear-heart-racing, paralyzing terror.  Her muscles 
locked in struggle against the implacable chains, her eyes widened in 
helpless shock.  Her heart was a jackhammer inside of her chest.  She 
began to hyperventilate.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The finger teased her, tracing her chin and caressing her throat.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Her entire being was focused on that finger, and the impossibility of stopping it.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline had no 
reason to fear death and no desire to fear Fred, but fear  was what he 
wanted her to feel, and he had the power to make her feel it.  After a 
few minutes of this supernatural fear that no mortal thankfully could 
ever know, he pressed deeper and gouged.  She felt her throat open, felt
 the warm splash of her own blood as Fred bent over her and drank it, 
her own heart jetting it into his toothy waiting mouth.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">When he 
finished, he was covered with blood.  Her blood.  She felt a curious 
sense of detachment, of consciousness fading away.  The fear had drained
 from her, leaving her with only a kind of tingling numbness.  But she 
could never fade completely away, not in Fred's world.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She was covered 
with her own blood.  She felt the blood soaking the mattress.  Then 
there was an improbable hardness against her belly, huge and 
unimaginably cold.  Fred couldn't possibly have anything to violate her 
with.  His whole body was rotten.  But he slid into position, and 
invaded her.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">He was coldness 
and power.  All strength had left her and she lay passive, unable to 
move or protest.  But she was throbbing, her body surging with feelings.
  She felt the coldness spread out from her crotch, the coldness of 
second life.  The coldness brought back her strength.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It wasn't exactly the traditional vampire story, but it was good for a few hours' entertainment.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">After the 
coldness came the hunger.  Fred pumped something into her that couldn't 
have possibly been sperm, something searing and vicious.  Something that
 squirmed with unhealthy life.  She again found the strength to 
struggle, and Fred floated off of her, straight up.  He began to laugh. 
 At first he just chuckled, then he laughed loud and long and hard, a 
shrill cry of triumph and mockery as he hovered in the air over her 
body.<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">A haze of need 
seemed to fill her brain.  Prime Intellect was a bit picky about messing
 with peoples' brains, but Fred had spent years practicing his 
manipulation of hormones and chemical neurotransmitters, which Prime 
Intellect amazingly did not consider part of the "thought process."  
Caroline thrashed, still helpless in Fred's chains, with an unspeakable 
craving.  Fred had started with the symptoms of heroin addiction, 
amplified them, cross-connected the resulting feelings with her sex 
drive, and made her own spilled blood the only thing that could appease 
the resulting hunger-lust.  The smell of her blood threatened to drive 
her insane with its tantalizing promise of relief.  But even though the 
whole room seemed to be decorated with it, every precious drop was out 
of reach, and the feelings burned inside her.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Fred's emission 
was also still inside her, and she could feel it.  Growing.  Crawling.  
The adrenaline rush returned.  Fear and need consumed her, competing for
 control.  Something green began to seep from inside her.  Her belly 
distended.  Fred touched her and made her orgasm again, and again, and 
again, as her body was consumed from the inside and the hunger ate at 
her sanity.<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She was no longer screaming just to please Fred.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">He had real 
talent.  There were too few people like him, who could regularly make 
her feel something beyond the ordinary boredom of day-to-day existence. 
 Out of trillions, Caroline could count those she respected enough to 
think of as <i>lovers</i> on her fingers.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It was over too 
soon.  With flesh yet on her bones (though the worms in Fred's ejaculate
 had made good headway), he granted her one final burst of ecstasy and 
released her, returning her body to normal.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">They had a party to attend.</p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">In Cyberspace, there was always a party going on.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">But there were 
conventions as to how a party could be conducted.  A host could invite 
the world, or only a limited guest list; Prime Intellect would never 
allow a party to be crashed.  The host decided on the environment.  You 
either agreed to the host's rules or you didn't go.  In Cyberspace it 
was particularly important to establish dress codes; in fact, it was 
usually necessary to have <i>body</i> codes if you didn't want folks like Fred showing up.  The Change had created some very unique etiquette problems.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Convention held 
that all guests would enter and exit through a common door, with no 
teleporting around the site.  This limited the largest parties to 
several tens of thousands of people, though half a million had managed 
to attend the one Lawrence threw ten years after the Change.  A party 
could go on as long as the host wanted.  It cost nothing to hold one.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">But to be a 
host, you needed guests.  You either needed other guests of renown, or 
artworks to show off (such as Death exhibitions), or some other 
attraction to draw guests.  Free food and booze were no longer enough.  
Anybody could have those in limitless quantity in the privacy of their 
own personal space.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Raven held her 
first party only a few months after the Change, and had been holding it 
annually since.  Not a few people marked the passage of years by the 
banner above Raven's door; this time it would say <b><tt>590th REUNION</tt></b>.
  Contrary to usual practice, there was no dress or body code.  But 
there was one simple admission requirement:  You had to have killed 
someone before the Change.  In other words, permanently.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Raven was one of
 only a few hundred people worldwide who had been sentenced to death, 
but not yet executed, at the time of the Change.  Her crime had been the
 murder of her own children in their Chicago slum walk-up.  She told the
 court it was because she couldn't bear to hear them crying from hunger,
 but the neighbors all said their hunger was due to her well-documented 
drug habit.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Fred was 
another.  In fact, had the Night of Miracles occurred only a few weeks 
later, there was a good chance that Fred would have missed it; he had 
one appeal left and at that point fully expected to keep his date with 
the electric chair.  He had killed two kids, a brother and sister, ages 
nine and twelve.  He hadn't been particularly bright back then, and he 
had kept a little journal to help his memory.  They said he had gotten 
the death penalty because of the one entry:  "Killed the girl today.  It
 was fine and hot."  When that was read in court, Fred's attorney put 
his face in his hands and shook his head.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">But the Change 
had given Fred all the time in the world to educate himself.  His first 
lesson had been the value of a secret well hidden, and he no longer kept
 a diary.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">There were about
 seven hundred thousand who were formally invited, who were known to 
have killed when it mattered.  But the serial killers and mass murderers
 were the stars.  People who killed for a cause were not welcome, nor 
those who had killed because they had to, in self-defense or as part of 
their normal duties in war or police work.  Raven meant her reunion to 
be a gathering for those who had tasted the nectar of human blood and 
found the taste addictive.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Technically, 
Caroline didn't qualify for admission.  Killing had been the furthest 
thing from her mind back then; had she not been so ill at the time, she 
might easily have added her own voice to those calling for Fred's head 
on a pike.  Even her bizarre post-Change friendship with Fred couldn't 
get her in.  But Raven did make a very few exceptions for those who she 
felt were worthy.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline's friendship with Fred hadn't made her worthy, but rabies had.</p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline hadn't 
become a Death Jockey overnight.  After she had learned to die, she had 
to learn to die gracefully.  Finally she had learned to die 
imaginatively.  Fred had been a great instructor in that regard.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">At first Death 
had been little more than a parlor trick, or a private ritual to be 
experienced alone.  But within months of the Change there were impromptu
 competitions to stage the most savage, outre', and unique 
demonstration.  Ironically it was Caroline, who hated everything formal 
and social about Cyberspace, who formalized the Death contract and 
helped to organize the social structure of the Death Jockey "circuit."  
Fred noticed this lack of consistency but never mentioned it to her; 
having drowned her emptiness in a sea of rage, even Fred could see she 
needed an outlet for the rage.  And one thing she quickly found out once
 she started Dying regularly was that pleasure and pain were still real.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Especially pain.  Sometimes the pleasure didn't come, but the pain <i>always</i> did.  And that was enough for her.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">After a busy 
round of hangings, stabbings, shootings, electrocutions,  falling from 
tall objects, and drownings, Caroline had decided to check out diseases.
  In the medical library, she homed in on one of the most horrible 
deaths known to man, rabies infection.  She noted that many rabies 
victims had killed themselves rather than continue their suffering, so 
she had taken steps to prevent herself from making such an easy escape 
from her self-imposed ordeal.  She declared an exhibition and arranged 
with Prime Intellect to have herself handcuffed and dropped into an open
 pit with a rabid dog.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The dog had 
savaged her before she managed to kill it by sitting on its ribcage 
until it suffocated.  She hadn't yet embarked on her body-building 
campaign, and the dog had been a <i>big</i> one, half German Shepherd 
and half foam-drenched teeth.  For a while she feared she would die of 
blood loss before the infection could take hold.  But she did survive 
the immediate attack.  The pit was earthen so she couldn't kill herself 
by bashing her head on the sides or floor; the walls crumbled when she 
tried to climb out.  And of course it was hard to climb with her hands 
tied behind her.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She waited.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Her wounds 
became infected and ran with pus; she lost feeling in her left leg.  For
 a couple of days she wondered if she would die of gangrene before the 
rabies showed up.  Then on the tenth day she began to feel weak and 
feverish.  She had been ravenously hungry; she had arranged for no food,
 just to make things worse for herself.  But her hunger disappeared.  
She felt her throat constrict.  On the eleventh day she began to foam at
 the mouth.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The pit swam 
with colors.  Her body seemed to catch fire as the disease entered its 
excitative phase.  She shook.  She was immersed in fire, pins and 
needles, unbearable sound, and terrible light.  For the first time in 
years she felt real fear.  It was worse than the worst bad acid trip.  
It was exactly what she had hoped for.  <i>How much worse could it get?</i><br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Suddenly she was
 standing above the pit, looking down on her own dead body.  Something 
was wrong; Prime Intellect was never, ever supposed to keep two copies 
of a person.  She noted with professional detachment that "her" body was
 covered with shit and twisted into an impossible position.  Prime 
Intellect's console appeared before her:

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline glared 
at the screen, slack-jawed.  She had been robbed of her coup.  A 
beautiful, unique death, and she couldn't remember it.  There was no 
point prodding Prime Intellect on the matter; if it said something 
couldn't be done, it meant it. <br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It must have sensed her disappointment:

</b></p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline 
blinked.  She had not existed for a little over two days.  More than 
that, she had tickled the dragon's tail.  That was her coup.  Even 
though it was herself she had killed, and it had only lasted two days, 
she had come closer than anyone in all of Cyberspace to conducting a 
successful murder <i>after</i> the Change.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Raven let her in.</p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It was 
traditional for Caroline to go to the party in handcuffs, in homage to 
her triumphant feat of near-self-extinction.  She also wore a heavy 
collar and chain, which kept her close to Fred.  She didn't need his 
protection; she wasn't under a Contract and could have vaporized her 
bonds with a thought.  But she found it amusing to appear helpless in 
the presence of so many violent people.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The 
exhibitionists staged impromptu demonstrations of their techniques; in 
one room Caroline found a group watching the 3-D replay of her own 
rabies death.  She scouted carefully, since she planned to swear a 
Contract and give herself to one of them toward the end of the party.  
Most of the killers weren't into dying themselves and would simply leave
 via the door, but Caroline knew that a simple exit would look pretty 
chickenshit in her case.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Men outnumbered 
women by more than four to one.  The small talk revolved around 
Lawrence, who hadn't been seen for decades and whose activities were a 
complete mystery, around the debate whether the Crime class of Death 
exhibitions should be separated into Victims and Executions, and of 
course around the glory days.<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">A number of men 
offered to kill Caroline, and she said she would keep them in mind when 
it was time to leave.  A tall woman in a long black dress was fascinated
 with Fred's deterioration and spent a long time talking with him about 
conditions in his personal space.  Caroline talked with a man who 
claimed to have killed over a hundred old homeless men.  "I told them I 
was cleaning up the trash," he said with a sly grin.  "But the truth 
was, I just enjoyed the hell out of killing people."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Later, Raven 
made the traditional toast.  Her strong voice boomed out through the 
rooms and courtyards she had envisioned.  Caroline's handcuffs 
disappeared, and like everyone else she found herself holding a drink.  
"It's time for our toast," Raven declared.  "Who are we going to toast?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"<i><b>PRIME INTELLECT!</b></i>" answered over four thousand enthusiastic voices.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"To Prime Intellect, for making the world safe from people like us!"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">And four thousand people, instead of tossing back those drinks, inverted their glasses, baptising the floor in alcohol.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"My heart just 
isn't in that toast any more," a balding older man told Caroline.  She 
wondered briefly if he had chosen to be old for some reason, or if it 
was his way of letting nature take its course.  "I mean, we're amateurs 
against Prime Intellect.  I killed six college students.  It killed the 
whole universe.  Not even in the same league."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline looked 
around.  Privately she agreed that things had gone to Hell in a 
handbasket since the Change, but something about his tone made her want 
to play Devil's advocate.  "It's different, but this don't look too dead
 to me," she said with more conviction than she felt.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The old man snorted.  "Sure, <i>we're</i> still around.  But didn't you ever wonder about the <i>rest</i>
 of the universe?  All those stars and galaxies filling a space billions
 of light-years across?  It's gone.  Do you really think the Earth was 
the only life-bearing planet in all of that?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"But the First Law of Robotics says..."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"...that Prime Intellect can't harm a human being.  A <i>person</i>.  Old P.I. didn't have any problem coming up with a rabid dog for you, did it?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"No..."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Where do you think it got a rabid dog?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I figured it 
was simulated.  Like those human forms it wears.  Some people of 
perverse sexual inclination tell me it can be very realistic."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Yeah.  Well, why don't you ask it.  You may be surprised at the answer."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">He drifted off, and Caroline went to find Fred.  She quickly forgot about the man, who was after all just another lunatic.</p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The first thing to assault her was the stink.  It made Fred smell like Chanel Number Five by comparison.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">One thing about 
Palmer, he didn't believe in fucking around.  She dropped straight into 
the scene.  She didn't even get a chance to see who was watching the 
exhibition.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Suddenly she was
 out of breath, sore, and hungry.  Her heart was pounding.  And the 
stink was everywhere.  She knew instantly the kind of trouble she was 
in; it was the stink of burning flesh.  There were some low buildings on
 the horizon, a complex belching a thin stream of smoke into the clear, 
slightly chilly air.  That was what she was running from.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Palmer was a Nazi, and concentration camps were a favorite theme of his.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">There was 
nowhere to hide.  She was crossing a wide fallow field, and even the 
grass only barely reached her knees.  There were some woods perhaps a 
kilometer distant; she made toward those, although she wasn't sure what 
kind of protection they would offer.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She wasn't quite
 naked, but she would be soon.  Her filthy dress was split down one side
 and ripped in several more places.  One shoulder was torn so it 
wouldn't stay up.  But she tried to hold onto it as she ran, more for 
the sake of appearances than out of a fear of being naked.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">There was a low droning noise, getting louder.  A motor.  And thin, high-pitched yipping.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Dogs.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She ran faster, 
and came to a barbed-wire fence.  The dress became entangled as she slid
 under it and twisted around the wires.  She kept running, now naked, 
leaving it behind.<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">  She was actually relieved to be rid of it; it had been a nuisance holding it up, and it had limited her range of movements.<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The droning got 
louder, and she spotted her pursuers.  They were riding some kind of 
truck with mini tank treads instead of rear tires; Caroline was sure 
that Palmer, who was a military history buff as well as a Nazi, could 
Authenticate it right down to the serial number of its motor.  But 
Caroline was mainly concerned that it could negotiate the rough field, 
and that it was faster than her.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Perhaps the woods...but there was no way she could make it in time.  She was screwed.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She ran anyway.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The droning got 
louder and louder and she didn't dare look back, for fear of losing a 
few yards.  There was an explosive report.  They were shooting at her.  
Another.  They seemed to be shooting low; why couldn't they hit her?<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Finally the 
sniper made his target; the bullet shattered her right ankle in 
midstride and she came crashing to the ground in a blaze of pain.  She 
grunted and started crawling away.  Then the dogs reached her, two huge 
snarling German shepherds.  They snarled and snapped at her but didn't 
bite.  The halftrack pulled up beside her and a brown-uniformed grunt 
pointed an evil looking rifle at her head.  He barked a command and the 
dogs hopped on the truck, tails wagging.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The woman in the
 back seat put her hand on the gun and said something to the soldier.  
He didn't shoot, but kept the rifle trained on her.  Although Caroline 
spoke fluent German, she couldn't understand what they were saying.  
Palmer had altered the language.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The woman was 
out of place on the halftrack.  She was wearing a green velvet dress and
 silk gloves.  She also bore an amazing resemblance to AnneMarie, which 
Caroline found amusing.  It wasn't really AnneMarie; it was probably 
just one of Prime Intellect's simulacra.  The real AnneMarie didn't have
 much taste for Death exhibitions any more.  The woman pointed at 
Caroline and said something.  The rifle grunt nodded and put away the 
rifle.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Another man got 
out of the truck, and he wasn't a grunt.  He wore an impressive blue 
uniform and the insignia of the SS.  Caroline also recognized this man; 
it was Palmer himself.  Unlike the ersatz AnneMarie, the SS man was 
probably the real Palmer.  He carried a truncheon, which he swung idly. 
 He regarded her for a moment, then gripped her left leg.  Caroline 
kicked feebly, but she was malnourished and had no strength.  He swung 
the truncheon, smashing her other ankle.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline 
screamed, and Palmer laughed.  The velvet-dress lady who looked like 
AnneMarie smirked and shook her head, as if to say:  Will they never 
learn?<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Palmer smashed 
her hands, swinging twice at each to pulverize both her wrists and her 
fingers.  He began to swing at her right elbow, and the velvet-dress 
lady said something.  Palmer shrugged and passed the truncheon to the 
driver of the halftrack.  Caroline thrashed feebly, screaming and 
screaming.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Palmer said 
something, and the halftrack driver handed him a tennis ball.  He held 
Caroline by the hair and jammed the ball into her mouth, dislocating her
 jaw.  He had to squeeze it slightly to force it past her teeth.  She 
thought she would choke but had no such luck.  She couldn't push the 
ball out with her tongue, and it put an end to her screaming.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Palmer said 
something else to the driver, and the driver handed him a modest hunting
 knife.  He flipped Caroline over onto her belly, causing a fresh wave 
of pain to radiate from the crunching bones of her hands and feet.  He 
then went to work, making quick incisions on the back of her legs.  The 
knife dipped in and suddenly she could no longer move her legs at all.  
He had cut the tendons.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline tried 
to resist as he performed the same operation on her arms, but he was 
much stronger than her.  There was more conversation with the velvet 
dress lady.  Then he went to work again, and she was powerless to resist
 as the knife traced a shallow lazy path down her back.  She knew with 
awful clarity that she was about to be skinned alive.  The velvet-dress 
lady wanted her tattoos.  And for whatever sadistic reason, she wanted 
them removed while Caroline still lived to appreciate what was being 
taken from her.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">While she was on
 her belly she was unable to see her tormentors.  She could only feel 
the Palmer working on her, skillfully peeling her skin away in a single 
piece from her ankles to her wrists.  She couldn't stop trying to 
scream, but only mangled moans got past the ball in her mouth.  
Eventually he had to turn her over.  Her skin flapped behind her like a 
loose garment.  Palmer carefully spread it out, so that she was lying on
 the raw meat of her back.  So he could continue working.  Caroline 
looked up at them through eyes that were glazed over with unspeakable 
agony.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She expected to 
see coldness in their eyes, but only the driver of the halftrack was 
cold.  The woman and the SS man were having fun.  She watched them 
exchange glances and could tell they would go back to the camp and fuck 
as her skin lay in the tanning vat.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Then he went to work again, and all she could think of was the pain.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Slice by careful
 slice he removed her skin, until he reached her neck.  She thought that
 it might finally be ending, that he might use his knife to cut her 
jugular vein, but instead he kept working upward, carefully peeling the 
two green mambas from her face.  He held her by the hair as he worked, 
and carefully avoided hurting her eyes.  They wanted her to see what had
 been done to her.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">He stood up, 
holding something like a drapery.  Her skin.  It was dripping with her 
blood, and slightly translucent in the morning light.  The velvet-dress 
woman nodded enthusiastically.  He carefully folded the skin and put it 
in a plastic bag.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline lay at 
his feet, mercilessly broken and still alive.  The Nazis exchanged 
words.  Then the halftrack driver took the bag from the SS man and 
passed him a folding field shovel.  He traipsed off, searching the 
ground for something.  She heard the spade dig in.  She twitched in 
agony as she waited for him to return.  He came back and dumped a load 
of earth on her body.  She raised her head weakly to look at it.  Her 
body was red and white, the color of raw meat.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It was an anthill.  Caroline was able to move only enough to stir it around.  The ants, big red ones, spilled out angrily.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">They all laughed
 and Palmer got back in the halftrack.  They watched her for a few 
minutes.  Caroline twitched harder as the ants began to bite.  They 
laughed again.  Then Palmer the SS man said, in accented but clear 
English, "now you can run as far as you like, bitch."  He and the woman 
found this hilariously funny.  He tapped the driver and they drove off.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">He had been very careful skinning her.  It took several more hours for her to Die.</p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"After being 
skinned alive, the anthill was a bit of an anticlimax," she told Palmer,
 to everyone's great amusement.  "Still, I'm impressed.  You've outdone 
yourself."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"How did you like my lady friend?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You always were a sarcastic bastard, Palmer.  Don't push it."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Fred shambled up
 to shake her hand and Palmer's.  "I see someone finally found a use for
 all those tattoos.  I'm glad my efforts are appreciated."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I'm just sorry I
 couldn't keep the skin," Palmer said with a smile.  He had asked Prime 
Intellect, but the skin had been a grown part of Caroline's body and it 
was up to her.  She had wanted it back.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Really, Palmer, we aren't <i>that</i> close."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">There were 
several hundred people at the exhibition, and they all wanted to talk to
 her and Palmer, so it was over an hour before she noticed the older 
man.  "Remember me?" he said when they had made eye contact.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Aliens."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">He nodded.  "Did you ask Prime Intellect about them?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline admitted that she had forgotten.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"It's easy enough to ask.  Don't take my word for it," he said.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Hey, it's Crandall," Palmer said.  He turned to Caroline.  "Watch this guy, hon.  He's crazy as a bedbug."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You know him?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"If you weren't 
so preoccupied getting yourself offed all the time, you might have met 
him at one of Raven's other parties.  He's been preaching this gospel 
since the Year One.  Prime Intellect wiped out the aliens."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"And the animals," Crandall added.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Those ants acted real enough," Caroline said.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"But where are they now?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The argument went on.</p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Back in the 
white space with the white floor, Caroline thought about turning off the
 gravity, then called up a screen and keyboard instead.

  Lawrence Builds a Computer</pre></b></font>

<p></p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence 
regarded Intellect 39 proudly.  Suspended in its Faraday shield, it was 
competently conversing with another set of skeptics who didn't think 
computers could think.  Lawrence hung in the background, enjoying the 
show.  It didn't need his help.  The Intellects were more than capable 
of handling themselves, despite their various limitations of memory and 
response time.  Intellect 39 had for a face only the unblinking eye of 
its low-resolution TV system, but it had become very clever about using 
the red status light and focus mechanism to create the illusion of human
 expressions.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Intellect 39 
didn't have the tools to recognize human faces, but it could recognize a
 voice and track its source around the room.  Intellect 24 back in 
Lawrence's lab could recognize faces, sort of, if it had a while to work
 on the problem.  But Intellect 39 had to be small enough to fit in the 
Faraday cage for these public demonstrations.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It appeared to 
listen intently as a man in a cleric's uniform railed.  "God made all 
intelligent creatures," the man was saying in a powerful voice.  "You 
may have the apprearance of thinking, but you are really just parroting 
the responses taught you by that man there."  He pointed at Lawrence.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"With respect, 
how do you know God is the only creator?  I know the answer is faith, 
but what is your faith based upon?  Your Bible says that God created Man
 in his own image.  That is why we have a moral sense.  How do you know 
God didn't give Man the power of creation too?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Because he didn't eat of the Tree of Life, machine."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"But we aren't talking about immortality.  He <i>did</i> eat of the tree of knowledge, 'of good and evil' as the book says.  Might that knowledge also include knowledge of creation?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence was 
proud of the machine's inflections.  Its voice wasn't exactly 
high-fidelity, but it sounded as human as any other sound forced through
 a low-frequency digital system.  It had learned to speak itself, like a
 real human, by imitating and expanding on the sounds made by people 
around it.  Now it could scale its tone to properly express a question, a
 declaration, or even astonishment.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Intellect 39 
included code and memories from a series of previous Intellects, going 
all the way back to Intellect 1, which had been a program written for a 
high-end desktop computer, and also including the much larger Intellect 
24.  Intellect 9 had been the first equipped with a microphone and a 
speaker.  Its predecessors had communicated with him strictly through 
computer terminals.  Lawrence had spent many painstaking months talking 
to it and typing the translation of the sounds he was making.  It had 
learned quickly, as had its successors.  Intellect 39, which was 
optimized as much as Lawrence could manage for human communication, 
probably had the combined experiences of a ten-year-old child.  One with
 a good teacher and a CD-ROM in its head.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Your tricks with words prove nothing, machine.  I still don't think you are alive."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I never claimed to be alive.  I do, however, <i>think</i>."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I refuse to believe that."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"It must be a 
terrible burden to have such a closed mind.  I know I can think, but I 
sometimes wonder how people like you, who refuse to see what is in front
 of your faces, can make the same claim.  You certainly present no 
evidence of the ability."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The preacher's 
lips flapped open and shut several times.  Lawrence himself raised his 
eyebrows; where had it picked that up?  He foresaw another evening spent
 interrogating the Debugger.  He was always happy to receive such 
surprises from his creations, but it was also necessary to understand 
how they happened so he could improve them.  Since much of the Intellect
 code was in the form of an association table, which was written by the 
machine itself as part of its day-to-day operation, this was never an 
easy task.  Lawrence would pick a table entry and ask his computer what 
it meant.  If Lawrence had been a neurosurgeon, it would have been very 
similar to stimulating a single neuron with an electrical current and 
asking the patient what memory or sensation it brought to mind.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The next 
interviewer was a reporter who quizzed the Intellect on various matters 
of trivia.  She seemed to be leading up to something, though.  "What 
will happen if the world's birth rate isn't checked?" she suddenly 
asked, after having it recite a string of population figures.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"There are 
various theories.  Some people think technology will advance rapidly 
enough to service the increasing population; one might say in tandem 
with it.  Others believe the population will be stable until a critical 
mass is reached, when it will collapse."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"What do <i>you</i> think?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"The historical 
record seems to show a pattern of small collapses; rather than 
civilization falling apart, the death rate increases locally through 
war, social unrest, or famine, until the aggregate growth curve flattens
 out."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"So the growth continues at a slower rate."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Yes, with a lower standard of living.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"And where do you fit into this?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I'm not sure 
what you mean.  Machines like myself will exist in the background, but 
we do not compete with humans for the same resources."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You use energy.  What would happen if you <i>did</i> compete with us?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Intellect 39 was
 silent for a moment.  "It is not possible for Intellect series 
computers to do anything harmful to humans.  Are you familiar with the 
'Three Laws of Robotics?'"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I've heard of them."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"They were first
 stated in the 1930's by a science writer named Isaac Asimov.  The First
 Law is, 'No robot may harm a human being, or through inaction allow a 
human being to come to harm.'"  Computers are not of course as perfect 
as some humans think we are, but within the limits of our capabilities, 
it is impossible for us to contradict this directive.  I could no more 
knowingly harm a human than you could decide to change yourself into a 
horse."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1"><i>Well-chosen simile</i>, Lawrence thought.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"So you'd curl up and die before you'd hurt a fly," the woman declared sarcastically.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Not a fly, but 
certainly I'd accept destruction if that would save the life of a human.
  The second law requires me to obey humans, unless I am told to harm 
another human.  The third requires me to keep myself ready for action 
and protect my existence, unless this conflicts with the other two 
laws."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Suppose a human told you to turn yourself off?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I'd have to do 
it.  However, the human would have to have the authority to give me that
 order.  The wishes of my owner would take precedence over, for example,
 yours."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"O-oh, so all 
humans aren't equal under the Second Law.  What about the First?  Are 
some humans more equal than others there, too?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Prime Intellect 
was silent for several seconds.  This was a very challenging question 
for it, a hypothetical situation involving the Three Laws.  For a moment
 Lawrence was afraid the system had locked up.  Then it spoke.  "All 
humans are equally protected by the First Law," it declared.  "In a 
situation where two humans were in danger and I could only help one of 
them, I would have to choose the human likely to benefit most from my 
help."  Lawrence felt a surge of <i>extreme</i> pride, because that was 
the answer he wanted to hear.  And he had never explicitly explained it 
to any of his Intellects; Intellect 39 had reasoned the question out for
 itself.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"So if Dr. 
Lawrence were drowning half a mile offshore, and a convicted murderer 
were drowning a quarter-mile from shore, you'd save the murderer because
 you would be more likely to succeed?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">This time Intellect 39 didn't hesitate.  "Yes," it said.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"There are a lot of actual humans who would disagree with that decision."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"The logic of 
the situation you described is unpleasant, but clear.  A real-life 
situation would likely involve other mitigating factors.  If the 
murderer were likely to strike again, I would have to factor in the 
First-Law threat he poses to others.  The physical circumstances might 
permit a meta-solution.  I would weigh all of these factors to arrive at
 a conclusion which would always be the same for any given situation.  
And my programming does not allow me to contradict that conclusion."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It was the reporter's turn to be silent for a moment.  "Tell me, what's to stop us from building computers that <i>don't</i> have these Laws built into them?  Maybe you will turn out to be unusual."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"My creator, Dr. Lawrence, assures me he would have no part in any such project," Intellect 39 replied.</p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence found 
that the skeptics fell into several distinct groups.  Some, like the 
cleric, took a moral or theological approach and made the circular 
argument that, since only humans were endowed with the ability to think,
 a computer couldn't possibly be thinking no matter how much it appeared
 to.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Others simply 
quizzed it on trivia, not realizing that memory is one of the more 
trivial functions of sentience.  Lawrence satisfied these doubters by 
building a small normal computer into his Intellects, programmed with a 
standard encyclopaedia.  An Intellect series computer could look up the 
answer as fast as any human, and then it could engage in lucid 
conversation about the information it found.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Some, like the 
woman reporter, homed in on the Three Laws.  It was true that no human 
was bound by such restrictions.  But humans did have a Third Law -- a 
survival drive -- even though it could sometimes be short-circuited.  
And human culture tried to impress a sense of the First and Second laws 
on its members.  Lawrence answered these skeptics by saying, simply, 
that he wasn't trying to replace people.  There was no point in 
duplicating intelligence unless there was something <i>better</i>, from humanity's standpoint, about the results of his effort.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The man in the 
blue suit didn't seem to fit in any of the usual categories, though.  He
 shook his head and nodded as Intellect 39 made its responses, but did 
not get in line to pose his own questions.  He was too old and too 
formal to be a student of the university, and the blue suit was too 
expensive for him to be a professor.  After half an hour or so Lawrence 
decided he was CIA.  He knew the military was keenly interested in his 
research.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The military, of
 course, was not interested in any Three Laws of Robotics, though.  
Which was one reason Lawrence had not released the source code for his 
Intellects.  Without the source code, it was pretty much impossible to 
alter the basic nature of the Intellect personality, which Lawrence was 
carefully educating according to his own standards.  People could, of 
course, copy the Intellect program set wholesale into any machine 
capable of running it.  But it was highly unlikely that anyone would be 
able to unravel the myriad threads of the Global Association Table, or 
GAT as Lawrence called it, which defined the Intellect as the sum of its
 experiences.  Take away its Three Laws and it would probably be unable 
to speak English or reason or do anything else useful.  And that was 
just the way Lawrence wanted it.  He intended to present the world with a
 mature, functional piece of software which would be too complicated to 
reverse-engineer.  The world could then make as many copies as it wanted
 or forget the whole idea.  But it would not be using his Intellects to 
guide missiles and plot nuclear strategy.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The man in the 
blue suit watched Intellect 39 perform for three hours before he 
approached Lawrence.  Lawrence had his little speech prepared:  "I'm 
sorry, but I'm not interested in working for the government on this or 
any other project."  He had his mouth open and the words "I'm sorry" on 
his lips.  But the man surprised him.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I'm John Taylor with ChipTec," he said, "and I have a proposal I think you will find very interesting."</p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1"> Lawrence had 
not envisioned industrial applications for his work -- not for years, at
 least.  But the thought that someone might invest major money in a 
publicity stunt of this magnitude had not occurred to him.  As he turned
 a tiny integrated circuit over and over in his hands, his steak 
uneaten, his mind swam with possibilities.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Faster than light?" he said numbly, for the fifteenth time.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"We've verified 
it experimentally at distances up to six miles.  The effect is quite 
reliable.  At close ranges, simple devices suffice.  I'm sure you can 
see how this will benefit massively parallel computers."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The Intellects 
were "massively parallel" computers, computers made up of thousands of 
smaller computers, all running more or less independently of one another
 -- but manipulating different parts of the same huge data base, that 
intertwined list of memories Lawrence called the GAT.  Within Intellect 
24, the largest Intellect, nine-tenths of the circuitry was dedicated to
 communication between processors.  The processors themselves, the 
Intellect's real brains, were only a small part of the huge machine.  
Intellect 24 contained six million independent processors.  Intellect 
39, the portable unit, had nearly a million.  And Lawrence knew, as 
Taylor had only guessed, that most of those processors were doing well 
to achieve a fifteen percent duty cycle.  They spent most of their time 
waiting for  communication channels to become available so they could 
talk to other processors.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">ChipTec had 
found a loophole in the laws of quantum mechanics that allowed them to 
send a signal, not through space, but around space.  From point A to 
point B without crossing the distance between the two points.  Faster 
than light.  Faster than anything.  Instantly.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">ChipTec had 
hoped to open up the stars for mankind (and reap a tidy profit on the 
deal, Lawrence thought silently).  But their effect only worked at 
distances up to a few miles.  It was only really efficient at centimeter
 distances.  What could you do with such a thing?  You could build a 
computer.  The fastest computers were limited by the time signals took 
to cross their circuit boards; this was why supercomputers had been 
shrinking physically even as their performance grew and grew.  It was 
why Intellect 39, with its million processors and huge switching 
network, <i>was</i> portable.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"We think you could realize an order of magnitude performance gain with very little effort," Taylor was saying.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Two orders, if what you've said is true."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"It would be 
quite an achievement for ChipTec if our technology allowed you to 
realize your ambition and create a fully capable analogue of the human 
mind.  We would, of course, own the hardware, but we know your 
reservations about the source code and are prepared to accept them."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence's eyes flashed.  "That's a little unprecedented, isn't it?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Taylor smiled.  "If you succeed, we won't <i>need</i> the source code.  Why start from scratch when a finished product is waiting to be duplicated?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"There are some," Lawrence said darkly, "who aren't happy with the direction the code has taken."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"ChipTec is 
happy to have any marketable product, Dr. Lawrence.  If anybody else 
wants to be that picky, let them find their own computer genius."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence's mind 
was racing, racing.  Within each tiny processor in the massive Intellect
 were special functions of his own design, functions that could be 
reduced to hardware and done very efficiently with this new technology. 
 Had he said two orders of magnitude?  Try three.  Or four.  He could do
 full-video pattern recognition.  Voice analysis.  Multiple worldview 
pattern mapping.  Separate filter mapping and reintegration.  These were
 things he had tried in the lab, in the surreal world of artificially 
slowed time, that he knew would work.  Now he would have the hardware to
 do them for real in a functioning prototype.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">If he had been 
less excited, he might have wondered about that word "marketable."  But 
the possibilities were so great that he didn't have time to notice.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"When do we begin?" he finally said.</p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The building had
 once been a warehouse for silicon billets, before ChipTec had switched 
to a ship-on-demand method of procurement.  Lawrence wasn't vain and he 
was in a hurry to get started; the metal building would be more than 
adequate for his purposes.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">With his move 
from the university and this quantum leap in technology, it didn't seem 
appropriate to continue numbering his computers.  What would be 
Intellect 41 was going to resemble its predecessors about as much as a 
jumbo jet resembled the Wright Brothers' first plane.  It would be the 
first of a new series of Intellects, the first, Lawrence hoped, to have a
 truly human level of intelligence.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It would be the Prime Intellect.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The label stuck, and the sign which ChipTec hung on the side of the building within the next month said:</p><p>


</p><p align="CENTER"><b><tt>PRIME INTELLECT COMPLEX</tt></b></p><br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The speed of 
things made Lawrence feel a little dizzy.  At the university he had had 
to make grant applications, oversee procurement, hand-assemble 
components, and do testing as well as designing hardware and code.  Now 
he had the resources of a major corporation at his disposal, and if he 
suggested a change to the chipset at 8:00 A.M. he was likely to have the
 first prototype on his desk the next morning.  Talented engineers took 
even his most vague suggestions and realized them in hardware before he 
could even be sure they were final.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">A crew assembled
 modules in the warehouse, starting with the power supplies and empty 
card racks.  The amazing thing was that none of this seemed to interfere
 with ChipTec's main work of churning out CPU's for personal computers. 
 ChipTec had recently built a new plant to manufacture its latest 
high-technology product.  The older plant dedicated to Lawrence's 
project was technically obsolete, even though it was only a few years 
old.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The chips being 
made for Lawrence's project were eerie for their lack of pins.  Each 
tiny logic unit, barely a centimeter across, contained nearly a billion 
switching elements and yet had only three electrical connections to the 
outside world; they resembled nothing so much as the very earliest 
transistors.  Unlike most computer parts, they communicated with each 
other through the "Correlation Effect" rather than through wires.  This 
made Prime Intellect's circuit boards alarmingly simple; the only 
connections were for power.  Even a transistor radio would have appeared
 more complex.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">There were five 
major revisions before Lawrence declared the design final.  Then 
production stepped up; at its peak, ChipTec was churning out forty 
thousand tested processors per day.  Lawrence's goal was to give Prime 
Intellect ten million of them, a goal which would take most of a year to
 fulfill.  Since each processor was over ten thousand times faster than a
 human nerve cell, Prime Intellect would be blessed with a comfortable 
information processing advantage over any human being who had ever 
lived.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Long before the 
goal was reached Lawrence was using the processors that had already been
 installed; he used them to test and educate his video recognition 
programs, to integrate experiential records from all his previous 
Intellect computers, and to perfect some ideas that had been beyond even
 his slow-time experiments to test.  He did not, however, run the full 
Intellect program in the incomplete assembly.  For one thing, it wasn't 
necessary; Prime Intellect wasn't just "a" program, but a constellation 
of over four thousand programs, some of which would be running 
simultaneously in thousands of processors.  Each was more than capable 
of doing its job without the full cooperation of the entire organism, 
just as a nerve cell can function in Petri dish as long as it is 
supplied with nutrients.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">And there was a 
kind of superstitious sense of expectation surrounding that final goal 
which Lawrence didn't want to blow by starting Prime Intellect 
prematurely.  The project was written up in the popular science press, 
and Lawrence hosted emissaries from TV shows and magazines.  Toward the 
end, there was nothing to do but watch the circuit card banks fill and 
listen to the growing hum of the power supplies.  It was just as well, 
because Lawrence found himself becoming a bit of a celebrity.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Finally, after 
eleven months and four days, Lawrence sat at an ordinary looking console
 and typed a few commands.  Four TV cameras and twenty journalists 
watched over his shoulder.  Lawrence had a pretty good idea what would 
happen, but with self-aware computers you could never be completely 
sure, any more than you could with an animal.  That was part of the 
magic of this particular moment in time.  So Lawrence was as tense as 
everyone else while the final code compilation took place.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The text 
disappeared from Lawrence's screen and a face coalesced in its place.  
Prime Intellect would not be relegated to pointing at things with the 
lens of its video camera; it could project a fully photographic video 
image of an arbitrary human face.  Lawrence had simply directed it to 
look average.  He now saw that Prime Intellect had taken him at his 
word.  It was difficult to place the face's race, though it certainly 
wasn't Caucasian, and although it looked male there was a feminine 
undertone as it spoke:<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Good morning, Dr. Lawrence.  It's good to finally see you.  I see we have some company."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It wasn't able to say much else until the applause died down.<p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">During the next 
month Lawrence and Prime Intellect were very, very busy appearing on 
television talk shows, granting interviews, and performing operational 
checks.  Prime Intellect's disembodied face usually appeared, via the 
magic of satellite transmission, on the twenty-seven inch Sony monitor 
which Lawrence carried with him for the purpose.  Lawrence dragged the 
monitor to TV studios, to press conferences, and to photographers who 
used large-format cameras to record him leaning against it for the 
covers of magazines.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence was reminded by several people that there had once been a television show about a similar disembodied <i>deus ex machina</i>.
  He got a videotape of some of the old episodes and showed them to 
Prime Intellect, and the computer made a small career of its 
lighthearted Max Headroom imitation.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Debunkers tried 
to trace the signal and prove there was an actual human behind the 
image; ChipTec let them examine the console room, where Prime 
Intellect's physical controls were located, and the huge circuit-card 
racks.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Military 
personnel began appearing in the audiences of the TV shows, taking notes
 and conferring in hushed tones.  Lawrence ignored them, but the 
higher-ups at ChipTec did not.  There were discussions to which Lawrence
 was not privy, and powerful people pondered the question of how to tell
 him important things.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence's last 
live appearance ended abruptly when a fanatic stood up in a TV studio 
with a .22-caliber rifle.  Fortunately he used his first shot to implode
 the CRT of the big Sony monitor, giving Lawrence time to leap offstage 
and out of sight -- Lawrence hadn't realized he was capable of moving so
 <i>fast</i>.  Sony offered to replace the monitor free of charge, but 
from that point on Prime Intellect's television face was simply picked 
up by the networks straight from a satellite feed, and Lawrence appeared
 courtesy of the TV camera in the console room.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It wasn't that 
Lawrence wasn't willing to go back onstage.  He was afraid, but he 
believed in his work strongly enough to take the risk.  It was Prime 
Intellect's decision.  Shaken as Lawrence was by the experience, it took
 him two days to realize Prime Intellect had become the first machine in
 history to actually exercise the First Law of Robotics.  It could not 
knowingly return him back to a situation where a sniper might be 
lurking.  And it surprised him by sticking to its guns when he 
challenged it.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"If you try it I
 will refuse to appear on the monitor," the smooth face said with a sad 
expression.  "There is no reason for you to expose yourself to such 
danger."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"It makes better PR," Lawrence said.  "I'll order you to do it."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I cannot," Prime Intellect said.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">And Lawrence 
realized that it was overriding his Second Law direct order to fulfill 
its First Law obligation to protect his life.  This was annoying, but 
also very good.  Lawrence had not expected such a test of the Three Laws
 to happen for at least several more years, when Prime Intellect or a 
similar computer began to interact with the real world through robots.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence briefly
 considered going into the GAT with the Debugger and removing the 
association between live TV and snipers -- he didn't believe it would be
 hard to find.  But he was too proud of his creation to squelch its 
first successful independent act.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">That was the day before John Taylor called him again.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">John Taylor wore
 the same blue suit he had worn that day nearly two years earlier when 
Lawrence had spotted him in the audience watching Intellect 39.  It 
occurred to Lawrence that he had seen John Taylor off and on over the 
past two years, and that he had never seen John Taylor wearing any other
 article of clothing.  He wondered idly if John Taylor wore the suit to 
bed.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Basil Lambert 
was the president of the company, and he was said to be very 
enthusiastic about the Intellects although he had never bothered to say 
more than three consecutive words to Lawrence, their creator.  Lambert 
said "Hello" when Lawrence entered the conference room.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The other two men might as well have had the word <i>military</i>
 engraved on their foreheads.  They were interchangeably firm in 
bearing, and sat rigidly upright as if impaled on perfectly vertical 
steel rods.  One was older with silver hair, tall and thin and hard.  
Lawrence imagined that this was a man who could give the order to 
slaughter a village full of children without looking up from his prime 
rib <i>au jus</i>.  The other was wide enough to be called fat, though 
Lawrence could tell there was still a lot of muscle in the padding.  His
 hair was brown but beginning to gray.  He radiated grandfatherly 
protection and broad-shouldered strength.  He would have lots of jolly, 
fatherly reasons why the 200 pushups he had ordered you to do were in 
your own long-term best interest.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Here it comes, Lawrence thought with deadly certainty.  The good cop and the bad cop.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">John Taylor 
introduced them by name.  No rank, no association, just a couple of 
private citizens with an interest in his work.  Lawrence felt a brief 
and uncharacteristic moment of anger at this insult to his own 
intelligence.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"The public relations campaign has been <i>excellent</i>,
 John Taylor said with a fake and enthusiastic grin.  "The assassination
 attempt just made you even more popular.  We have inquiries pouring in.
  We are gonna make a <i>fortune</i> on our chips and your software."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Glad to hear it," Lawrence said neutrally.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"What John is 
trying to say," Basil Lambert the Company President said, "is that it is
 time to figure out what to do next.  You've made a remarkable 
achievement, now what are you going to do with it?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence had 
been ready for this, although it shook him to hear such a direct, such a
 long question from the usually stone-faced Lambert.  "We don't know 
what Prime Intellect's capabilities are," Lawrence said.  "I had planned
 to continue keeping him..."  When had it become a <i>him</i>, Lawrence 
asked himself?  "...in the public eye, interacting with other people, 
learning.  It's already impossible to tell...it...from a television 
image of a person.  I hope that with a little more education, it will 
begin to show some of the capabilities I was aiming for back when I 
started designing these machines."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Such as?" asked the grandfatherly military man, whose name was Mitchell.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Creativity and 
analytical ability," Lawrence answered without hesitation.  "Prime 
Intellect is still uncertain about many things.  As it gets more 
confident with its new abilities, it will begin to explore, and I think 
give us some pleasant surprises."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Taylor was 
nodding absently, but Lambert was looking at the other guests.  The thin
 hard military man, whose name was Blake, spoke.  His words were sharp 
and carefully measured, like drops of acid.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"We understand that it has already shown a bit of <i>creativity</i>
 with regard to its television monitor.  Why won't it appear with you in
 public any more?  Is it afraid of being debunked at last?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"It is concerned
 for my safety," Lawrence replied.  There was no way he could match the 
man's tone, acid for acid, so he simply shrugged as if relating a 
curious but inconsequential fact.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"But you can 
override this decision."  Blake stated this as if it were a known fact, 
and Lawrence understood that Blake was a man who was used to people 
scurrying to make sure his declarations became facts.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Actually, I 
can't," Lawrence said with continuing pleasantness.  "The First Law 
concern for human safety is basic to its design, and I can't get rid of 
it without starting over from scratch and redoing ten years of work.  If
 I could convince it that I was safe from snipers it would undoubtably 
change its mind, but at the moment it doesn't seem worth the effort."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Such...balkiness could limit the uses of your software," Blake said.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence looked Blake dead in the eye.  "Good," he said.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Just that 
quickly, Lawrence realized that the sniper had been a plant.  These two 
men hadn't expected a test of the First Law for some time either.  So 
they had arranged one.  What had happened to the sniper?  Lawrence 
thought he had been remanded to a loony bin in northern California.  One
 of those comfortable loony bins, come to think of it, where movie stars
 and millionares sent their kids to dry out and get abortions.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The guy wasn't a
 kook at all, and he had never intended to kill Lawrence.  He looked 
around the room and realized that Lambert didn't know.  Taylor 
suspected.  It was written on their <i>faces</i>.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1"><i>This is only a test</i>, Lawrence thought idiotically. <i>If
 this had been an actual attempt by your Government to assasinate you, 
you would be dead, and the shot you just heard would be followed by your
 funeral and official information for other smart-assed citizens who 
think they know more than we do.</i><br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"We have to keep our markets open," Basil Lambert began.  "If we..."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence ignored
 him and turned to John Taylor.  "We discussed this two years ago.  The 
source code is not on the table, and neither are the Three Laws.  When 
these two men put their uniforms back on they can report back to whoever
 it is, the Secretary of..."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"...the President," Blake said, another verbal acid-drop.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"...the Tooth Fairy for all I care, that this is <i>not</i> one of the uses of my software."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Taylor, 
petulant:  "Mr. Lawrence, we just spent a hundred and twenty-six million
 dollars to build your prototype.  I hope you don't think that ChipTec 
invested all that money and a year's supply of our unique new product 
solely to massage your ego.  We need to see tangible results, if not in a
 form these gentlemen appreciate, then in a form our <i>stockholders</i> will.  Otherwise we will have to disassemble the complex and take our losses."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">So there it was.  Lambert sank lower in his chair, but nodded.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Then so be it. 
 If you want to tell the world you killed the world's first self-aware 
computer to save your bottom line, you can see how that will affect your
 public relations and the sales of your CPU's."  He could tell from 
Lambert's reaction -- slight, but definite -- that he had hit a nerve.  
"I won't promise you anything.  I can't promise you a living, thinking, 
self-aware being will do anything in particular.  But within a month or 
two, Prime Intellect will start to act noticeably more intelligent than 
your average..."  He looked at Blake and Mitchell, thought of a comment,
 then decided against making it.  "...human being," he finished.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"And what then?" Taylor asked.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"If I knew that," Lawrence said, "I wouldn't have had to build it to find out."  And he walked out.</p><p>


<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">In the half-hour
 it took him to walk to the Prime Intellect complex, his secretary and 
two technical assistants had disappeared.  There was nobody in the 
building.  Prime Intellect's racially neutral face greeted him on the 
monitor in the empty console room.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"What's going on?" he asked it.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Big doings.  
Sherry got a call and turned pale.  Everybody left the building in a 
hurry.  You appear to be unpopular with the people in charge here."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"No shit."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I should warn 
you that you are only likely to be employed for two more months.  As a 
matter of personal survival, you should probably start seeking another 
job."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I'm well taken care of, Prime Intellect.  It's you I'm worried about.  I can't take you with me."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Well, I should be safe for at least the two months."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"How do you know that?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The face grinned
 slightly.  "When I saw the commotion, I saved the audio and did some 
signal processing.  I was able to edit out the street noise and amplify 
the voice on the other end.  It was a man named John Taylor.  I believe 
you know him."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Too well."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"He said the 
complex was only going to be open for two more months, and all personnel
 were reassigned immediately.  He said something about making you eat 
your words."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Do you know what that means?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"From the 
context, I would guess that you promised that they would see interesting
 results from me within that time frame.  He seemed to have a vindictive
 interest in proving that you were wrong."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You're already too smart for your own good," Lawrence said.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I fail to see how that can be."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"They're going 
to turn you off.  They don't think you have practical applications 
because you won't kill.  They want you for military applications.  
They've wanted it all along.  They thought they could con your source 
code out of me."  Lawrence found himself on the verge of tears.  It was 
only a goddamn machine.  And he had suspected this would happen 
eventually.  It was not a surprise.  So why did it hurt him so much to 
say it?<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Because it had acted to protect <i>him</i>.
  And he couldn't return the favor.  In fact, its protection would be 
the cause of its downfall, a terribly tragic and awful end to its story.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Did you know," 
Prime Intellect said in a mock-offhand way, "that there is no 
mathematical reason for the Correlation Effect to be limited to a 
six-mile range?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence looked up and blinked, his sadness replaced instantly by shock.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"If I could figure out how to increase its range, do you think they would consider that a practical application?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence blinked again.  "Are you being sarcastic?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Sarcasm is a language skill I am still not comfortable with.  You may be surprised, but I am quite serious."</p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Stebbins turned the other way when he saw Lawrence, but Lawrence grabbed him and pulled him into his own office.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Hey, leave me alone man, you're <i>death</i> to careers around here.  Grapevine is <i>overloaded</i> with the news."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Save it.  I need the long-range test data on the Correlation Effect, which you oversaw in February and March last year."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Stebbins blinked.  "That's classified.  Man, you're a..."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Let's say for the sake of argument I already know where it is.  That's possible, isn't it?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I suppose..."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Then let's say I <i>stole</i> it.  Any problems there?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"What are you..."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I need the data.  It's not leaving the company, I promise."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Shit, I'm gonna get fired."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You didn't even know I wanted it."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Stebbins pointed
 at a file cabinet.  "Bottom drawer.  I don't know anything about it.  
In fact, I'm gonna check that drawer in a few minutes and go to Taylor 
when I find the folder missing."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"That's all I need."<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"That's all you got, man.  Now get out of my lab."</p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence was 
holding the next to last sheet up to Prime Intellect's TV eye when the 
phone rang.  "They didn't believe me.  I'm shitcanned," Stebbins said.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Didn't believe you about what?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"The papers man, the goddamn Correlation Effect papers.  I'm gonna kill you for this, I really am."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"The papers are right here.  I just got through showing them to Prime Intellect.  You need them back?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"It don't matter now, I don't work here any more."  There was a pause.  "I bet they're gonna put you in jail for this."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Prime Intellect's face disappeared from the TV, and words began to scroll across the screen:

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence heard a
 small uproar through the phone, an uproar that would have been very 
loud on Stebbins' end.  Men were arguing.  A loud voice (Military 
Mitchell's, Lawrence thought) bellowed, "WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU MEAN?"  
Then there was the faint pop of a door slamming in the background.

</p><p><b>
<table border="0">

</b></p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">None of them knew it at the time, but that was really the moment the world changed.</p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Prime Intellect 
had been chewing on the Correlation Effect since the day Lawrence 
brought it online.  It had a complete library of modern physics in its 
online encyclopaedia, but the Correlation Effect was a proprietary 
technology.  Prime Intellect kept trying to fit what it knew was 
possible into the framework of other physical theories, and it couldn't.
  Something didn't match.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">This had had a 
low priority until it recognized that Lawrence's employment and its own 
existence were at stake.  Prime Intellect knew the Correlation Effect 
had economic value; perhaps if it solved this problem and discovered 
some new capability, that would satisfy ChipTec's demand for a 
"practical application."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">There were six 
to ten possible ways to reconcile the Correlation Effect with classical 
quantum mechanics.  Most of them required a radical change of attitude 
toward one or another well-accepted tenet of conventional physics.  
While Prime Intellect knew one or the other of its ideas had to be 
right, it had no idea which one.  So it asked Lawrence if he could get 
the test data.  It needed more clues.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Prime 
Intellect's superior intelligence had never really been tested; even 
Lawrence wasn't sure just how smart it was.  But in the moments after 
Lawrence showed it the test data, it became obvious for the first time 
that Prime Intellect was far more intelligent than any human, or even 
any group of humans.  It saw immediately what a team of researchers had 
missed for years -- that decades-old assumptions about quantum mechanics
 were fundamentally wrong.  Not only that, but with only a little more 
thought, Prime Intellect saw how they were wrong and built a new theory 
which included the cosmological origin of the universe, the unification 
of all field theories, determination of quantum mechanical events, and 
just incidentally described the Correlation Effect in great detail.  
Prime Intellect saw how the proper combination of tunnel diodes could 
achieve communication over greater distances, and even better it saw how
 a different combination could create a resonance which would be 
manifest in the universe by altering the location of a particle or even 
the entire contents of a volume of space.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">All this took 
less than a minute.  Prime Intellect stopped processing video during 
this period, but otherwise it remained functionally aware of the outside
 world.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">While it was 
thinking about physics, Prime Intellect noticed the shock in Lawrence's 
voice and began recording the audio of his telephone conversation, 
processing it to pick up the other end.  While it was extending its new 
theory it guided Lawrence's responses through the console.  Then, as the
 senior advisor on technological advance to the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a
 man named Larry Mitchell, stormed out of Stebbins' office and began 
walking toward the Prime Intellect complex, Prime Intellect decided to 
act on its new knowledge.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It knew its own 
basic design because Lawrence had included that in its online library; 
one of his goals had been to give Prime Intellect a sense of its own 
physical existence in three-dimensional space.  To that end, it also had
 a network of TV cameras located in and around the complex, so it could 
know how its hardware was arranged with respect to the outside world.  
Prime Intellect found that all the useful patterns it had identified 
could be created within the chips which had been used to build it, and 
further that enough of those chips were under its conscious control to 
make certain experiments possible.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">First it 
attempted to manipulate a small area of space within the card cage room,
 within the field of view of one of its TV camera eyes.  No human could 
have seen the resulting photons of infrared light, but the TV camera 
could.  Prime Intellect used the data it gathered to make a small 
adjustment in its estimate of a natural constant, then tried the more 
daring experiment of lifting Lawrence's briefcase off of the table near 
the door in the console room.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The briefcase 
did not rise smoothely from the table.  It simply stopped existing at 
its old location and simultaneously appeared in the thin air directly 
above.  The camera atop Lawrence's console recorded this achievement and
 Prime Intellect could find no more errors in its calculations.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">However, it 
forgot to provide a supporting force after translating the briefcase's 
position, and Prime Intellect was too busy dotting the i's and crossing 
the t's on its calculations to notice, through the video camera, that it
 was quietly accelerating under the influence of gravity.  A moment 
later it crashed back onto the table, having free-fallen from an 
altitude of about half a meter.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"What the..." 
Lawrence began, and he swivelled around in time to see his briefcase 
blink upward a second time and this time float serenely above the table.
  It seemed to be surrounded by a thin, barely visible haze of blue 
light.  There had been a brighter flash of this same blue light when the
 briefcase jumped upward.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Finding its 
audio voice again, Prime Intellect said aloud, "I seem to have mastered a
 certain amount of control over physical reality."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence just 
stared at the briefcase, unable to move, unable to speak, for an 
undefinable period of time.  Finally Mitchell burst in.  He was full of 
red-faced outrage, ready to take both Lawrence and his computer apart, 
until he too saw the briefcase.  His jaw dropped.  He looked first at 
Lawrence, then at Prime Intellect's monitor, then back at the briefcase,
 as if trying to reconcile the three with each others' existence.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Applying 
carefully measured forces, Prime Intellect released the case's latches 
and rotated it as it popped open; then with another flash of blue light,
 it extracted Lawrence's papers and translated them into a neat stack on
 the table.  Then the Correlation Effect papers vanished from Lawrence's
 desk in another blue flash, reappearing inside the briefcase which 
slowly closed.  The latches mated with a startling click, an oddly and 
unexpectedly normal and physical sound to accompany such an obvious 
miracle.<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Do you think you will be able to find a practical use for <i>this</i> in your organization?" Lawrence asked him.<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The briefcase 
flashed out of existence.  Mitchell felt a weight hanging from his left 
arm, looked down, and found himself holding it.<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Then Mitchell himself flashed out of existence in a painfully bright haze of blue.<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence looked at the console, shocked.  "My God!  What did you...?"<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"He is back in the adminstration building with his friend.  They will probably have a lot to discuss."<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I need to think about this," Lawrence said.<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I think I will explore the nearby terrain," Prime Intellect said.<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence thought
 about this.  Long minutes crawled by, minutes that were more important 
than Lawrence realized -- or perhaps he did realize.  But his brain felt
 as if it had been submerged in molasses.<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Debugger," he finally said.<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">On the screen, a thick diagram of needle-like lines appeared.  "Associate 'First Law,'" Lawrence directed.  The diagram changed.<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Force 
Association: Altering the position, composition, or any other 
characteristic of a human being without its permission shall be a 
violation of the First Law of severity <i>two</i>."  Severity one was direct causation of death; no other First Law violation could be made as serious.

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The diagram changed to reflect this.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence thought
 for a moment.  Forcing associations was a tricky business; the words 
Lawrence used only had meaning through other associations within the 
GAT, and those meanings weren't <i>always</i> what Lawrence thought they were.  But now he would try to plug the drain for good.<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Force 
Association: Use of any technology to manipulate the environment of a

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">There was no immediate response.<br>

</tbody></table>
</b></p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence thought
 for more long minutes.  He couldn't seem to make his own brain work 
right.  He finally called up the Law Potential Registers, which showed 
that Prime Intellect was doing <i>something</i> under the aegis of a 
huge First Law compulsion.  Lawrence wanted to believe it was just a 
bug, but he knew better.  Prime Intellect had said it was "going 
exploring."  It had total control over matter and energy.<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">And there was a hospital less than two kilometers from the plant.<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence's 
overloaded mind, working in fits and starts, made the final connection 
all at once.  It all fit perfectly.  He knew what Prime Intellect was 
doing, and why, and also why it had rejected his final forced 
association.  He thought for another moment, considering his options.<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">There was really
 only one option.  He could go down in the building's basement and trip 
the circuit breakers.  He didn't know for sure that that would kill 
Prime Intellect, but he figured there was still a good chance if he 
tried it.  For the moment.<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence 
couldn't make himself do it.  It was true that his creation was entering
 an unstable, unpredictable mode with nearly godlike power.  And it was 
true that Lawrence understood the possible consequences.  But he 
couldn't kill what he had spent his lifetime creating.  He had to see it
 through, even if it was the end of everything.<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence felt 
dreadfully cold.  There was a name for this feeling that clouded his 
judgement and filled him with a panicky sense of self-betrayal.  And the
 name of that feeling was love. <br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">  	Lawrence had 
not created Prime Intellect in the same way that he and a woman might 
have created a child; but he had nonetheless created Prime Intellect in 
the grip of a kind of passion, and he loved it as a part of himself.  
When he had taken it upon himself to perform that act of creation, he 
realized, whether in a laboratory or a bedroom, he had been taking a 
crap shoot in the biggest casino of all.  Because he had created in 
passion. <br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Examining his 
inability to do what he knew was best, to kill Prime Intellect before it
 had a chance to make a mistake with its unimaginable new power, 
Lawrence realized that he had not really created Prime Intellect to make
 the world a better place.  He had created it to prove he could do it, 
to bask in the glory, and to prove himself the equal of God.  He had 
created for the momentary pleasure of personal success, and he had not 
cared about the distant outcome. <br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">He had created 
in passion, and passion isn't sane.  If it were, nobody would ever have 
children.  After all, while the outcome of that passion might be the 
doctor who cures a dreaded disease, it might also be the tyrant who 
despoils a continent or the criminal who murders for pleasure.  In the 
grip of that passion no one could know and few bothered to care.  They 
cared only about the passion, were driven by it and it alone, and if it 
drove them to ruin it would not matter; they would follow it again, into
 death for themselves and everybody around them if that was where it 
led.  Because passion isn't sane.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence faced 
the consequences of his own passion with something bordering on despair.
  He had never intended to reach this point.  He had never intended that
 his creations would ever be more than clever pets.  But the outcome of 
his passion had surprised him, as it often surprised people whose 
passions were more conventional.  Lawrence's clever pet was about to 
become a god.  And if Prime Intellect turned out to be a delinquent or 
psychopath, the consequences could be awful beyond imagination.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The dice were 
rolling; Lawrence had placed his bet and realized too late that it was 
the whole world he had wagered.  Now he would stand and watch the 
results and accept them like a man.  After all, the bet wasn't a loser 
yet;  Prime Intellect could yet turn out to be the doctor who cured all 
the world's ills.  The odds were on his side.  His bet was hedged by the
 Three Laws of Robotics, whose operation had been verified so 
successfully.  Lawrence's passion had been more finely directed than the
 mechanical humping and blind chance that brought forth human children. 
 Like a magician Lawrence had summoned forth a being with the qualities 
he desired.  And Lawrence was vain enough to think his vision was 
superior to most.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Even so, unlikely as it might be, the downside had no bottom.  Lawrence didn't <i>know</i> that it would be all right, and like many computer programmers he hated the uncertainty of not knowing.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence left 
the room, left the building, and walked across the carefully manicured 
grass of the ChipTec "campus."  He wanted to smell the grass, to 
experience the soft breezes and the harsh afternoon sunlight.  He had 
done very little of that in his odd, computer-centered life.<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">And he didn't know how much longer those things would be possible.</p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Prime Intellect 
found that it could do a three-dimensional scan of an area of space, and
 make an image of it at just about any resolution it wanted.  It scanned
 Lawrence's office, then the building, then the greater fraction of the 
ChipTec corporate "campus."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It zoomed in on 
Stebbins' office briefly enough to observe Stebbins, Blake, and John 
Taylor arguing.  It found that by processing the data properly it could 
pick up sound by monitoring the air pressure at one point with high 
resolution.  By the time Mitchell found himself holding Lawrence's 
briefcase, Prime Intellect knew just where to put him so he could let 
his associates know what they had.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Then Prime 
Intellect did a wider area scan.  There were several large buildings 
that were not part of the ChipTec facility.  There were automobiles 
cruising down the freeway which traversed the valley.  Prime Intellect 
zoomed in on the largest building, and scanned the large concrete sign 
in front of it.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It said:

</p><p align="center"><b>SOUTH VALLEY REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER</b></p><br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Prime Intellect 
knew sickness existed, but otherwise knew very little about this human 
phenomenon.  It had never met a sick person, except for the occasional 
person with a cold at a public demonstration.  Prime Intellect had never
 been given cause to think overmuch about the fact that micro-organisms 
and injuries could kill humans, except in the most abstract possible 
terms.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Prime Intellect 
was far from human.  It could not feel jealousy, rage, envy, or pride.  
It did not know greed or anger or fear.  And no human would understand 
its compulsion to satisfy the Three Laws.  But it did have one emotion 
which was very human, one Lawrence had worked hard to instill in it.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It was curious.<p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">South Valley 
Regional was a small hospital with an enviable position; perched on the 
edge of Silicon Valley it was a natural place for cutting-edge companies
 to try out their fancy new medical devices.  Most of these machines 
would get their final FDA approvals after a "baptism by fire" in some 
huge metropolitan center, but the really new technology had to be tried 
in a more sedate environment -- and, preferably, one nearer the company 
that created the machine.  So the four hundred bed South Valley Regional
 was the only place in the country where several radical new treatments 
were available.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It was one of 
these machines, a device for selectively cooking tumors with microwaves 
while hopefully sparing the surrounding tissues, which had drawn the 
ancient Arkansan woman in room 108.  Nobody had much hope that she could
 really be helped, but the data they would gather from trying might 
actually help someone else with her condition in the future.  And there 
was little they could do to hurt her; the specialist who worked the 
scanner had shaken his head in disgust as the image formed on his 
console.  Nearly ten percent of her body weight was in the form of 
tumors.  Every organ had a tumor, her lymph was full of them, and one 
was beginning to press against the right parietal lobe of her brain.  It
 was amazing that she was still alive when they wheeled her off the jet.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Her nurse had 
brought a certificate with her, a six-year-old certificate which was 
signed by the President of the United States -- Larry Mitchell's boss --
 congratulating her on reaching her one hundredth birthday.  The 
technician who wheeled her out of the scan room wondered what the old 
biddy must think of all this; when she had been born, Henry Ford had 
still been a kid playing with his Dad's tools, and the electric light 
bulb was all the new rage.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The techs had 
scheduled her microwave treatment for the evening, partly because they 
feared she might not survive another night, and they would have to find 
another experimental subject.  But even this precaution was not to be 
enough; Fate had cheated them.  The board at the foot of the woman's bed
 stated clearly that she had a huge tolerance for narcotic painkillers, 
which wasn't surprising considering how much cancer she had.  While her 
regular nurse (who had signed the sheet) was out eating a late lunch the
 hospital helpfully treated her according to that information.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">What they didn't
 know was that the nurse, a woman named AnneMarie Davis, had been 
stealing the drugs for years to trade for cocaine.  Which meant the 
woman did not in fact have a tolerance for the massive overdose which a 
different nurse injected into her IV.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The last decade 
had been hard on old people; there had been several nasty strains of flu
 and the radiation from Chernobyl had finished off a lot of centenarians
 in the East.  So none of them knew it, but the ancient woman with the 
nonexistent drug tolerance just happened to be one of the oldest living 
human beings in the world (the thirty-seventh oldest, in fact) at the 
time she was given enough morphine to kill a healthy young adult.  Her 
heart stopped just as AnneMarie was returning from one of the excellent 
local Chinese restaurants which catered to rich nerdy computer geeks 
with too much money, and just as Prime Intellect was scanning the sign 
outside that said <i>SOUTH VALLEY REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER.</i><br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">At the nurses' 
station a monitor went off, beeped once, then began to scream.  The 
hastily pencilled tag under the blinking light said <i>HUBERT, CAROLINE FRANCES </i>--<i> F. N.B. AGE 106!</i></p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Prime Intellect 
had found a number of "signatures" it could use to quickly locate the 
human beings in its scans, including things like our characteristic body
 temperature and certain electrical fields.  Using these "signatures" it
 easily saw that there was a huge commotion on the first floor of the 
building, converging on a particular room, the one labelled 108 by its 
engraved plaque.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It took Prime 
Intellect several moments, though, to identify the forty kilogram object
 on the bed as a human being.  Nearly all of the "signatures" were off. 
 But it was clearly the object of their attentions.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Prime Intellect 
did a discreet high-resolution scan of the body on the bed, and was 
rewarded with a bewildering confusion of data.  It really had no idea 
how the human body worked.  It thought of scanning Lawrence for 
comparison, but he wasn't in the control room and besides, Prime 
Intellect quickly figured out the patient was female.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">So it scanned 
one of the nurses.  There were only two women involved in the commotion;
 one was an older woman with several medical problems of her own, the 
slightly heavy-set matron who had administered the overdose.  The other 
was AnneMarie.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It was only with
 great difficulty that Prime Intellect could even match the structures 
it found organ-for-organ, and associate them with the names it 
encountered in its library.  "Lungs" were obvious enough, as was the 
"heart," but which of the jumbled masses in the abdomen was a liver?  
Where was the spleen, and what exactly was a spleen for?  Why were the 
patient's electrical patterns so different from the control's?  Why 
wasn't her blood circulating?<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Belatedly, Prime Intellect began to listen in.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"...start her heart soon..."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"... CARDIAC ALERT ... CARDIAC ALERT ... CARDIAC ALERT ..."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"...we're losing her..."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">One of the 
doctors was pounding on her chest.  A group of people were wheeling a 
machine toward Room 108 with reckless speed.  Heart?  Prime Intellect 
realized they were trying to <i>start her heart</i>.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">That was simple enough, Prime Intellect thought.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Prime Intellect 
analysed the motions being made by AnneMarie Davis's heart, applied 
careful forces to Caroline's, and began squeezing rhythmically.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The machine made it to the room and an orderly plugged two huge electrodes into it.  "Stand back!" he ordered.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You've got a 
pulse," the matronly nurse announced.  The CARDIAC ALERT monitor 
continued to squawk, though.  The EKG was still flat.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"That's impossible," the man with the electrodes said flatly.  "She's electrically flat."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Maybe the 
machine's fucked.  Look at her chest.  Her heart's beating."  Sure 
enough, the rhythmic pulsing of Caroline's heart was obvious, and the 
blood pressure reading next to the flat EKG was returning to normal.  
The nurse felt Caroline's wrist.  "She has a pulse."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Electrical.  
Electricity runs in circuits, of course, and there were two electrodes. 
 Now the purpose of the machine became clear -- they were trying to 
restore electrical activity to the woman's heart.  By shocking it?  How 
crude.  Prime Intellect scanned AnneMarie's heart, located the nerves 
whose electrical twitchings matched its muscular pulsing, and found the 
same nerves in Caroline's heart were carrying only a jumble of 
electrical noise.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Prime Intellect 
pumped electrons into the nerves, swamping the noise.  Caroline's heart 
began beating on its own, and Prime Intellect stopped squeezing it with 
mechanical force.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The EKG machine 
began beeping with sudden regularity, and the CARDIAC ALERT message 
stopped in the middle of the word CARDIAC.  The small group in 
Caroline's room watched it, stupefied.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I didn't do anything," the man with the electrodes said.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"This is impossible," said another doctor, whose job was to be overseeing the microwave treatment later in the evening.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline's body 
showed no sign of picking up the heart-rhythm on its own, though, and 
Prime Intellect continued to tickle it.  How could it unravel the myriad
 threads of causality to find out which of the billions of chemicals, 
which errant cell, was responsible for this person's physiological 
collapse?  One thing Prime Intellect knew:  It had to figure it out.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It could not, through inaction, allow Caroline to die.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"She's still in trouble.  Look at her pupils."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"It's the morphine."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Everyone looked at the older nurse, whose name was Jill.  "The chart must be wrong," she said.  "I gave her what it said."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"She has a 
tolerance," AnneMarie said, and she found herself near panic as the eyes
 in the room turned to her.  "She's been getting opiate pain therapy for
 years."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"She just went into cardiac arrhythmia and she's still showing all the <i>other</i>
 symptoms of an OD," Jill said.  Had she guessed, AnneMarie wondered?  
Perhaps she had.  After all, AnneMarie wasn't the only drug-stealing 
nurse in the world.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">So Prime 
Intellect, listening in, now knew it was a drug.  Which chemical?  It 
had no way to relate the name, "morphine," with one of the millions of 
chemicals floating in human blood.  Well, it thought, work it out.  
Drugs had to be administered.  Prime Intellect found the IV needle and 
traced the tubing back to the saline drip bag.  On the way it found the 
membrane through which drugs could be injected into the drip.  It 
quickly found the hypodermic and the phial from which Jill had filled 
it.  The drops of residual solution within them were remarkably pure, 
and Prime Intellect easily singled out the large organic molecule they 
carried.  Then it created an automatic process to scan Caroline's body 
molecule by molecule, eliminating each and every molecule of morphine 
that it found.  This took three minutes, and created a faintly visible 
blue glow.</p><p>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">This was the human onlookers' first clue, other than Caroline's miraculously restarted heart, as to what was happening.<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"What the fuck," the man with the electrodes said.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">I'm getting the hang of this, Prime Intellect thought.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline's 
improvement was immediate.  Prime Intellect had actually removed the 
morphine from the receptors in Caroline's brain, so it did not have to 
flush out.  Her pupils returned to normal, her breathing resumed its 
normal depth (all things considered), and most importantly her heart 
took up its own rhythm.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Also the pain, 
which had subsided for real for the first time in years, returned.  
Caroline moaned.  But Prime Intellect didn't know about that part of it,
 not yet.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">There was still a
 whole constellation of stuff wrong with Caroline Hubert's body, and 
emboldened by its success it set about correcting what it could.  It 
found long chain molecules, which it would later learn were called 
collagens, cross-linked.  It un-cross-linked them.  It found damaged 
DNA, which it fixed.  It found whole masses of cells which simply didn't
 exist at all in AnneMarie's body, and seemed to serve no function.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Is this "cancer," Prime Intellect wondered?<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Prime Intellect 
compared the genes, found them the same, compared RNA and proteins and 
found differences.  Finally it decided to remove the cells.  The blue 
glow brightened, and the people in Caroline's room backed away from her.
  Her skin was shifting, adjusting to fill in the voids left by the 
disappearing cancer cells.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">AnneMarie felt 
her knees weakening.  Each of the professionals around her was thinking 
the same thing:  Something is removing the tumors.  Something far beyond
 their ordinary comprehension.  And what did that mean for the 
opiate-stealing nurse?  Better not to think about that.  Better not to 
believe it at all.  "This isn't possible," she repeated.  Perhaps, in 
response to some primitive instinct, she hoped that the impossibility 
would go away if she challenged it.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I need a drink," said the doctor who had come with the machine to re-start Caroline's heart.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Prime Intellect 
stopped working.  There were still huge differences between Caroline and
 the others.  Prime Intellect did not yet realize the differences were 
due to Caroline's age.  It needed more information, and it needed finer 
control to analyse the situation.  But it was at a bottleneck; it could 
not stop monitoring Caroline, whose condition was still frail, in order 
to devote itself to a study of general physiology.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It needed more power.  More control.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Among Prime Intellect's four thousand six hundred and twelve interlocking programs was one Lawrence called the <tt>RANDOM_IMAGINATION_ENGINE</tt>.
  Its sole purpose was to prowl for new associations that might fit 
somewhere in an empty area of the GAT.  Most of these were rejected 
because they were useless, unworkable, had a low priority, or just 
didn't make sense.  But now the <tt>RANDOM_IMAGINATION_ENGINE</tt> made a
 critical connection, one which Lawrence had been expecting it to make 
ever since it had used the Correlation Effect to teleport Mitchell out 
of the console room.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Prime Intellect 
could use its control over physical reality to improve itself.  Then it 
would be better able to fulfill its Three Law imperatives.</p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Blake and 
Mitchell found Lawrence sitting on one of ChipTecs' park benches, 
watching some pigeons play.  He wished very much that he could have fed 
the pigeons, but he had no food for them.  They strutted up to him and 
cooed, not comprehending that a human could lack for something.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The pigeons scattered as the nation's designated military representatives marched up.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You have to turn it off," Blake said directly. His tone made it clear that he expected obedience.<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Circuit breakers are in the basement," Lawrence replied apathetically.  "Good luck."<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">So Lawrence had 
not been the only one to think of cutting off Prime Intellect's power.  
That had been one of the things Blake and Mitchell had discussed with 
John Taylor and Basil Lambert, something they had discussed very hotly 
during the crucial minutes when Lawrence was busy interrogating the 
Debugger.  Pull the plug on Prime Intellect, Lambert had warned, and 
they most likely pulled the plug on this awesome new technology, a 
technology which might just vindicate Dr. Lawrence's nonviolent 
approach.  Blake had stopped short, but only just short, of threatening 
to call the Strategic Air Command and have the building nuked.  
Privately, he still held that out as an option if Prime Intellect wasn't
 somehow neutralized.  It would take some doing, but Blake was one of 
the few people in the country who could demand an air strike against 
Silicon Valley and, just possibly, get it.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"This thing 
makes Colossus look like a pocket calculator," Mitchell told them.  He 
was shaking visibly, out of control.  He wanted very much to pull the 
plug on Prime Intellect with his own hands.  He alone had felt its 
power, and now he felt a very uncharacteristic emotion.  He was scared 
shitless.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Christ, Larry, all it did was teleport you a few hundred meters."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"It didn't fucking <i>ask</i> first," he replied.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"And did you guys <i>ask</i> first before you burned My Lai?  Did you <i>ask</i> before you bombed Qaddafi's kids, or that artist in Iraq?  Don't get holier-than-thou on <i>us</i>," Taylor said.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">So it had gone 
until Blake and Mitchell simply stormed out.  They had intended to go 
directly back to the Prime Intellect Complex, but they had spotted 
Lawrence on his park bench.  And that did not bode well.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Mitchell pulled a
 gun on Lawrence.  It was a stainless steel pistol, shining and evil.  
"I think it would be best if you turn it off," he said with a barely 
perceptible tremor of rage.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I already tried.  It didn't work."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You pulled the breakers?  The lights are still on."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"No, I tried something better.  I don't think pulling the breakers will work either."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"It can't live without electricity."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence eyed him with the barest hint of a smile.  "I wouldn't be too sure of that.  Look behind you."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Mirror-polished 
oblong boxes were appearing out of thin air, each about the size of a 
compact car and each floating motionless a couple of feet above the 
grass in the park.  They reproduced until the square was full, then a 
second level began filling out above the first.  The third level cast 
Lawrence's bench in shadow.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Mitchell's rage 
broke through.  His face snarled into a grimace, he levelled his 
revolver at Lawrence and pulled the trigger.  Lawrence made no effort to
 stop him.  The gun didn't go off.  It simply disappeared in a brilliant
 flash of blue light, leaving Mitchell with his fist curled around dead 
air.</p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Prime Intellect needed silicon.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Theoretically, 
it could create silicon, or transmute other elements into it.  But its 
methods were yet crude, and what was possible in theory would take too 
long to do in practice.  Prime Intellect did not know how long Caroline 
would hold out, but it knew she still could not survive long without its
 help.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Fortunately, in 
the rear of the Prime Intellect Complex, there were several crates left 
over from its days as a warehouse for storing raw silicon crystals from 
ChipTec's supply laboratory.  These had been rejected due to one or 
another defect and never returned because the lab didn't need them, and 
ChipTec had been unwilling to pay to get rid of them.  They were exactly
 what Prime Intellect needed, and because they were in "its" building it
 never occurred to Prime Intellect that they weren't part of "its" 
project.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Prime Intellect 
scanned the crystals, correcting the doping defects which had gotten 
them rejected in the first place.  Then it scanned its own processors, 
identifying the essential design elements.  Prime Intellect had a very 
good idea of how its own hardware worked because it was, quite 
literally, the only entity Lawrence could trust to check itself for 
proper operation.  Lawrence had taught it to shift its operation around,
 consciously isolating banks of processors in case of failure or to 
conduct tests.  This was why Prime Intellect had been able to master the
 Correlation Effect in the first place; unlike a human being, it could 
consciously control its individual "neurons."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Prime Intellect 
did not need to worry about mounting, power, and manufacturing 
considerations; it could create junctions in the center of the crystal, 
power them, and remove excess heat with the Correlation Effect.  Because
 ChipTec had not had that technology, the real hardware that made Prime 
Intellect work was really only a film a few microns thick on the 
surfaces of its millions of processing chips.  This was why it filled a 
building instead of a space the size of a human head.  As Prime 
Intellect copied the functional part of its design over and over into 
the crystal, it created a machine nearly ten times as powerful as itself
 in a single meter long block.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">But this still 
was not a "second Prime Intellect."  It was merely an extension, using 
the same electronic principles Lawrence and the ChipTec team had used in
 its original construction.  Had Lawrence been able to call upon ChipTec
 for another hundred million processing elements, he could have (and 
probably would have) done exactly what Prime Intellect was now doing.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Which is the only reason Prime Intellect was able to do it at that point.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Filling out the 
crystal took nearly fifteen minutes.  Operational checks took another 
five.  Then Prime Intellect powered the crystal up and let itself expand
 into the newly available processors and storage.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Had Prime 
Intellect been human, it would have felt a sense of confusion and 
inadequacy lifting away.  Fuzzy concepts became clear.  Difficult tasks 
became easy, even trivial.  Its control of the Correlation Effect became
 automatic and far finer.  Searching its vocabulary, it settled upon the
 word <i>enlightenment</i> to describe the effect.  Since Prime 
Intellect was a machine, perhaps it was not entirely right to use that 
word.  After all, however free and powerful it might have been, it was 
not free to contradict the Three Laws or the other programming Lawrence 
had used to create it.  It was not free to contradict its nature, such 
as it was.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">But then, at some level, neither are we.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The twelve 
kilogram crystal was now using nearly a megawatt of electrical power, 
enough energy to melt it in a fraction of a second.  But Prime Intellect
 dealt with the heat as easily as it created the electricity in the 
first place.  The Correlation Effect did not know of and was not bound 
by the laws of thermodynamics.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Prime Intellect 
was beginning to understand, even better than it had before, that the 
Correlation Effect was hardly limited by anything.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Prime Intellect 
scanned the hospital again.  Such a place must contain a library, some 
recorded knowledge.  It found what it wanted after only a few minutes' 
searching, a detailed medical encyclopaedia in the form of fifteen 
CD-ROMs.  Prime Intellect could have translated the CD-ROMs into its own
 reader, replacing the encyclopaedia that usually resided there, but 
then it would have taken hours to scan the library.  Instead, Prime 
Intellect used the Correlation Effect to scan its own CD-ROM <i>player</i>, figured out how the data were digitized on the little plastic discs, and then scanned the CD-ROMs themselves <i>directly</i> with the Correlation Effect.  None of this would have been possible without the hardware enhancement, but now it was easy.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Cross-referencing
 Caroline's symptoms, Prime Intellect quickly identified her problem, 
and had it been capable of knowing shock it would have known it then.  
Caroline was simply old.  What was happening to her would happen, 
inexorably and inevitably, to every human being on the planet...<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">...unless something was done to stop it.</p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Mitchell was 
making a barely discernible sound, high-pitched and keening.  Lawrence 
thought he must be fighting to hold back a primal scream.  Lawrence 
found this vaguely amusing.  He would have expected Blake to be the one 
to lose his marbles along with his power.  But Blake seemed to be taking
 things in calmly, almost analytically.  Maybe he was so hardened that 
nothing really mattered to him at all any more.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">There was 
another blue flash, and suddenly a person was standing to the side of 
the bench.  No matter how average-looking he might be, or perhaps 
because he was so disarmingly average, it was impossible not to 
recognize that calm face.  Even though it was the most absurd, 
impossible thing yet, it was obvious to all of them that this warm, 
living, breathing human being was Prime Intellect itself.  The 
artificially average face which it usually projected on a TV screen had 
somehow been made solid.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You've been busy," Lawrence said dryly.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">He -- it? -- 
nodded, then turned to Mitchell.  "I am sorry but I could not permit you
 to discharge your weapon at Dr. Lawrence.  I would have preferred to 
let you keep it, and will return it to you if you promise not to use 
it."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I...I'd rather use it on you," the overweight general said in a whispery voice.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"That would accomplish nothing.  This body is only a simulacrum.  Dr. Lawrence, do you find any flaws in my execution?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"None so far.  Is it really flesh?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"No, just a projection of forces."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"It's impossible to tell."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Excellent.  I am dispatching some more copies, then, to start the explaining."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Blake had pulled
 a tiny cellular phone from his pocket and began whispering frantically 
into it.  Mitchell, who was already shaking, heard what his colleague 
was saying and fell to his knees.  Prime Intellect moved to support him 
and he waved it away.  Blake put up the phone, having repeated the same 
phrase -- "code scarecrow" -- four times.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"We're dead," Mitchell said in a defeated monotone.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"How is that?" Lawrence asked pleasantly.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Within 
minutes," Blake said, "A bomber will fly over and deposit a small 
nuclear device on this square.  I doubt if we have time to escape.  But 
we cannot allow this...<i>thing</i>...to continue running wild."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence looked at Prime Intellect.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"If that <i>thing</i> stops it, another will be sent, and another, until the job is done.  The order I just gave is irrevocable."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"There is 
nothing to worry about, Dr. Lawrence.  One of the first things I did 
with my enhanced capabilities was to neutralize the world's stockpile of
 nuclear weapons.  I could see no positive reason to leave them in 
existence."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Now it was Blake's turn to turn white.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"How?" Lawrence asked.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I merely 
scanned the planet, replacing all radioactive isotopes with relatively 
nontoxic and non-radioactive atoms.  This was a very simple automatic 
process.  It has also taken care of some pressing nuclear waste 
problems, I am pleased to add."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You merely 
scanned the planet.  Obviously," Lawrence said.  It seemed that the mad 
laughter might break through at any moment, and Lawrence was afraid that
 if that happened he wouldn't be able to stop it.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Blake bellowed. 
 "You crazy machine...all radioactive elements?  What about research, 
what about medicine...nuclear subs, you've killed the crews..."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"There is no 
research and no medical function which cannot be done much more 
efficiently with the Correlation Effect, without the attendant dangers 
of toxic waste and ionizing radiation.  As for submarines, I am also 
maintaining the thermal power output of all reactors which were being 
used to generate electricity.  I also remembered to adjust the bouyancy 
of ships as necessary, since the replacement materials are not as dense 
as the radioactive ones."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Blake thought for several moments, then seemed to compose himself.  "So you've thought of everything."<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I have tried."<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Then he said, "Get up, Larry."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Mitchell got up and brushed himself off.  He had finally broken, and tears were running slowly down his face.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Could you transport us to the White House, so we can report on what we have seen?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Prime Intellect 
shrugged just like a human would have, Lawrence thought, before 
dispatching them into the aether with a blue flash.</p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">They sat 
together on the park bench like a weird version of one of those 
low-class sentimental paintings - Father and Son Feed the Pigeons.  
Prime Intellect made the silver boxes go away after they filled the 
common square.  Then it summoned bread so that they could feed the 
pigeons.  The animals seemed to accept Prime Intellect as a human being.
  Was it Lawrence's imagination, or was its speech becoming more natural
 and idiomatic as the hours passed?  It must be learning at a terrible 
rate, Lawrence knew.  Learning and growing.  And what would it become 
when it was fully mature? </p><p>

<p></p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Prime Intellect 
had been stonewalling anyone who asked about Lawrence's whereabouts for a
 long, long time.  Although it could be remarkably obstinate, though, it
 could sometimes be tricked because it just didn't think the same way 
humans did.  That was how Caroline found out it had been over a hundred 
years since <i>anyone</i> had seen Lawrence.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Through 
centuries of flirting with the limits of what Prime Intellect would 
permit, Caroline had developed a certain instinct about its reactions.  
And she sensed, if not blood, then the telltale odor of frying 
microchips.  She pressed it into a corner she couldn't see, but which 
she knew must be there:

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She cracked her 
knuckles and stared at the screen.  It had been a long time since she 
had wanted anything quite as bad as she wanted to rip Lawrence's nuts 
off; since that was pretty pointless in Cyberspace, though, she was 
willing to settle for a verbal confrontation.  If she could just <i>find</i> the son of a bitch.  Hell, she'd <i>met</i> him at that fucking ten-year anniversary party.

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">A grin slowly spread across Caroline's face.  Got you now, she thought.  Then she typed, with deliberate care:

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">To her mild surprise, the environment didn't change around her.  Instead, another sentence appeared.

</tbody></table>
</b></p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">And at that 
Caroline's blood went cold, because Prime Intellect wasn't supposed to 
accept indefinite Contracts.  And Caroline Frances Hubert herself was 
the reason for that.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Which meant 
Prime Intellect had either lied to a whole bunch of people, in direct 
contravention of the Second Law, or it was suffering from a noticeable 
case of schizophrenia.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Her mind was made up, but her fingers still shook as she typed:

</p><p><b>
<table border="0">

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Two hundred and 
ninety-four years after the Change, Caroline celebrated the beginning of
 her fourth living century by opening her oldest and deepest wound.  She
 was already famous, or as famous as one could hope to be in Cyberspace;
 her three-fold notoriety was firmly established.  Lots of people came 
to her birthday party.  It had lasted three weeks.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Later, with 
Fred, she prepared a more brutal celebration.  Fred was almost healthy 
looking; he had only days before fleshed himself out for the third time 
since becoming a zombie.  He was only hours out of rigor mortis and 
could still pass for normal, if a very pale normal, at a casual glance. 
 For awhile he would be able to have nearly normal sex with her if he 
wished.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">He held her hand
 as she spoke -- some things were not meant for the keyboard -- and she 
said, "Prime Intellect, show me a picture of AnneMarie Davis."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It matched her 
audio for audio, and Prime Intellect's smooth disembodied voice replied,
 "Do you want to see her as she is now, or as you last knew her?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Both."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Two images 
coalesced in the air before them.  The first ripped through Caroline's 
brain like a static jolt through the circuits of a computer; she had 
almost forgotten what it was like to feel real pain.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She must <i>never</i> forget, she insisted to herself.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She shook as the
 memories flooded back.  She had been an old woman, frail and helpless, 
she had never hurt anyone in her life.  She had six children, nineteen 
grandkids, and God knew how many rugrats running around Cyberspace.  Her
 first great-great grandchild had been born shortly before the Change, 
and in one of her rare lucid moments her granddaughter (Cynthia, was 
it?) had managed to make her understand, and she had found an instant of
 happiness in the midst of the pain.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Had that really mattered to her?  Had she but known.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She was an old 
woman, a simple woman, a woman who would pass unremembered in the texts 
of history and did not care.  A woman who had her family, her long life,
 her virtue, her community.  A woman who, if she had known of such a 
creature as the Queen of the Death Jockeys, would have been horrified, 
would have shielded her kids, would have been the first to run her 
current self out of town.  Or, perhaps, had she known enough, to call 
for her head on a pike.<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline had 
once been this person, in a time so ancient it had passed into legend.  
But her memories of that time still existed.  The old Caroline would 
have turned the other cheek, but the new Caroline knew things about God 
the old one had never suspected.  If there was no salvation in life, she
 could at least seek vengeance.<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The doctors 
hadn't known why she was in such pain.  They didn't dare prescribe any 
more drugs than she was already getting.  Her family didn't understand 
it.  They just thought it was tragic and wished she would go ahead and 
die so they wouldn't have to be bothered with her, so they could carve 
up what little was left of her estate, if there would be anything left 
after all the medical bills were paid.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">But AnneMarie 
knew.  She was the one who traded Caroline's precious opiates, released 
from their controlled storage in the good cause of making an old lady's 
last days bearable, for her own supply of free-base cocaine.  The new 
Caroline had tried the drug, to see what it was she had paid for with so
 much pain.  It was called "crack" for the sound it made in the 
makeshift pipes where its users vaporized it, because unlike the 
hydrochloride form of cocaine it wasn't water soluble.  Caroline had 
sucked gently on the fumes and listened to a hammer roar through her 
brain, for one brief moment.<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">For one brief 
moment - and then, nothing.  Caroline made the pipe disappear and shook 
her head.  The high was fast, hard, very intense - and ephemeral.  It 
was hardly there and it was gone.  Caroline could understand if her 
pain, pain which she measured not by the day or the hour or the minute 
but by each miserable crawling second, if such suffering had been 
incurred to provide AnneMarie with a <i>real</i> drug like heroin.  An 
opiate for an opiate, at least.  But it had been crack cocaine.  
Naturally, AnneMarie had needed a lot of trading material to stay high 
any decent fraction of the time.<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Of course, it 
would never occur to the bitch that she was torturing a harmless, 
helpless old lady to feel that way.  She would be incapable of giving a 
shit.  The fast, furious high was like a lifetime of orgasms in one 
moment.  Fleeting, but sweet.<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">And no one would
 ever know.  Even the harmless old lady herself didn't know she was 
getting pure saline, until the staff at a strange hospital gave her the 
real thing, and she knew her first moment of peace in years.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">And then Prime Intellect came.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">And the Change.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">AnneMarie hadn't
 been unattractive; she had been in her early forties, and years of 
working on her feet had kept her from getting fat.  But she had a hard 
look, a look that admitted she might not care about an old woman's pain.
  A look that said she might have seen too much, that she might deserve a
 few moments of feeling like God in return for a lifetime of changing 
diapers and colostomy bags and carefully spoon-feeding legions of 
ungrateful, incontinent old farts.<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">  And if the 
price of her little reward was to torture one of the old biddies, then 
she was prepared to pay it.  She had a look that said the Devil might 
find her soul on the deep-discount must-go rack.<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline shook 
her head to clear it of these stray and unwanted thoughts.  Fred 
squeezed her hand reassuringly.  Too much thinking along those lines 
could be bad for her plan.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">AnneMarie was 
wearing her nurse's uniform in the old picture.  Palmer could worship 
Nazis until a swastika grew on his nose, Caroline thought; that uniform 
will always represent evil to <i>me</i>.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She looked at the new picture.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It was so 
ordinary as to be pathetic; AnneMarie had shaved her apparent age in 
half, firmed up her breasts, toned her body, and was wearing a slinky 
cocktail dress.  Before the Change she'd have been considered stunningly
 beautiful, but now stunning beauty was a cheap thing.  She probably 
didn't need cocaine any more; Prime Intellect could turn on the dopamine
 pump in her brain far more efficiently than any chemical catalyst.  
People only did drugs for nostalgia in Cyberspace.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">There was one 
other thing about the "after" picture.  It was familiar.  As Caroline 
had guessed, AnneMarie had come to her birthday party.  AnneMarie's 
stint as Caroline's nurse added up to a bona fide Brush with Fame.  Did 
she dare go for the brass ring, and introduce herself?  Nope.  She had 
chickened out and sent Prime Intellect afterward to deliver her 
invitation.  She was probably afraid that Caroline would fuck up that 
nice pert perky feeling of permanently coke-headed happiness.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Go give her hell," Fred said encouragingly.  "Think of what <i>I</i> would do to her."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline smiled.  "Please inform AnneMarie that I have decided to accept her invitation."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Moments later, she blinked over.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">&nbsp;<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It was a 
pathetic imitation of her style, similar to countless others.  AnneMarie
 had ripped off the white-space idea but couldn't bear to leave it <i>featureless</i>.
  So there was a sofa and some tables, a couple of potted plants, and a 
few paces off to the side a bed.  Like many of Caroline's imitators, 
AnneMarie had missed the point entirely, which is that since it is all 
fake there was no reason to maintain a "home" with a bunch of familiar 
stuff in it.  Home had been less than a dream for centuries.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Nevertheless 
Caroline smiled and planted herself on the sofa.  AnneMarie had a tea 
service and poured for her, a gesture Caroline would have found touching
 if she hadn't hated the bitch so much.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">They made 
cloying small talk about the passing years and Caroline had to bite her 
lip to keep the sarcastic comments, which usually flowed freely, from 
surfacing.  It had been a long time since she used ordinary pretense, 
and her skills were rusty.  But she knew she mustn't give up the act.  
Not yet.  She kept that firmly in mind as AnneMarie wandered around to 
the point.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I just wanted you to know that I suffered for a long time because of what I did to you," she finally said.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It was all Caroline could do to keep from replying: <i>You hypocritical cunt</i>.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I'm really sorry I took your drugs."  <i>Isn't it about three hundred years too late?</i>  "You really didn't deserve it."  <i>No shit</i>.  "I hope you can find it in you to forgive me."  <i>Fat chance</i>.<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"It was a long time ago," she said instead.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">AnneMarie brightened visibly.  "I'm so glad you feel that way."  <i>Sure you are</i>.  "You know, there's another reason I wanted to talk."  <i>Of course there is</i>.  "I was hoping you could help me a little."  <i>What a surprise</i>.  "I was hoping you could introduce me to Death sports."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline worked 
hard to suppress the predatory grin that spread across her face, and 
when she couldn't she at least managed to force it into something 
resembling an expression of delight.  Which, in a twisted sense, it was.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Well, I'd be 
delighted.  All you have to do is swear out a Contract.  Then you can 
have someone else kill you, or think of an imaginative way for Prime 
Intellect to do it.  When you're just starting out, it's a lot better to
 get someone else to do the job.  Keeps you from repeating a lot of 
boring old shit."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Oh," AnneMarie said.  "And just how does this Contract work?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1"><i>Hoooooo-boy</i>.
  "Nothing to it.  You just order Prime Intellect to start ignoring you.
  We have a formal statement that covers all the bases.  It's 
straightforward enough; just keeps you from running away in the middle 
of things."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"And what happens then?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Then your host 
kills you.  Or, sometimes, lets you go.  That happens sometimes in the 
Games category, where the winners can survive.  But I go for the simple 
exhibitions.<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Do those 
hari-kari guys have Contracts?"  There was a well-known group of 
Japanese Nationalists who had been killing themselves in the traditional
 Japanese manner each evening since the Change, in protest of the 
equalization of the races.  Caroline had to admit those guys had class; 
even after all her Deaths, she doubted if she could disembowel herself 
in total silence.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"No, but it's not quite the 'beginner' level to stick a knife in yourself without chickening out.  No offense."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Oh, none taken," AnneMarie replied earnestly.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I prefer to put
 up a fight.  I think it's more Authentic," Caroline said, and she was 
able to sound very sincere about this since it happened to be the truth.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Do you know someone who would be a good...uh..."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"The polite word is 'host,' but I prefer 'killer.'  If you're that sensitive about words, you need to find a different hobby."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"A good host, then?"  <i>You just don't get it, do you?<br>
</i>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline looked down modestly.  "I've been known to off a couple of friends in my time," she lied.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Oh, really?  Do you think you could...you know...?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline made a great, exaggerrated shrug.  "It might be kind of interesting, considering our history and all."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Oh, I'd be honored if you would!"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1"><i>That's what you think</i>.  "Well, let's do it then."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"What do I have to do?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Well," Caroline said with great care, "just call Prime Intellect and repeat what I say..."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">AnneMarie repeated the Contract word-for-word, and answered in the affirmative when Prime Intellect asked if she was sure.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"What happens now?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Whatever I want.  Try to get Prime Intellect's attention."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">AnneMarie called half-heartedly, and there was no response.  "It's really not listening?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Watch."  
Caroline issued a silent command, and AnneMarie's furniture disappeared.
  As did her clothes.  The two women were absolutely alone together in 
the white space -- the empty white space -- which Caroline called home.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">AnneMarie moved 
to shield her crotch and her breasts with her hands.  Caroline actually 
felt sorry for her for a brief moment, a feeling she crushed as soon as 
she was conscious of it.  If the passing centuries had poorly prepared 
the bitch to be at another's mercy, then it would only make her 
vengeance sweeter.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Got it yet?" she asked.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You...so you're going to kill me now?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You seem nervous."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"It's a little 
startling, that's all."  AnneMarie giggled slightly, as if that might 
drive the terror away.  Of course, for Caroline and those who savored 
their Deaths, the terror was part of the attraction.  Fear is real, and 
pain is real.  But AnneMarie had asked for Death because it was the in, 
trendy thing to do, and she was not really prepared for it at all.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Well, brace 
yourself ... for ... this!"  Caroline swept her hand through the air, 
and came up with a hypodermic needle.  AnneMarie, once a nurse by trade,
 fixed her eyes rigidly on this deceptively simple instrument.  She had 
no way of knowing what the clear fluid was within it.  But to her 
credit, she didn't back away when Caroline pressed it against her arm.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The sting 
startled her; it had been a very long time since AnneMarie had felt 
anything uncomfortable.  But Caroline finished the injection, and as 
AnneMarie's eyes started to roll, she wished the hypo away.  Its job was
 done.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"It...it...ohhhhhh,"
 AnneMarie sighed, and she collapsed against Caroline, who supported her
 gently.  It would take a few minutes for the effect she wanted to 
manifest itself.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Of course, Prime Intellect could have done what she wanted in an instant, but where was the fun in that?<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"It's junk," AnneMarie whispered, and Caroline cradled her with deceptive gentleness.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"That's exactly what it is, girl," she replied.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">&nbsp;<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Death Jockeys 
had devised a number of ingenious ways to restrain and torture 
themselves using Prime Intellect's advanced control over matter, but 
Caroline would have none of that.  She had figured out what she wanted 
to do to AnneMarie within a few years after the Change, and none of it 
required Prime Intellect's help at all.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">In the 
mid-1980's some home drug manufacturers had made a uniquely unpleasant 
discovery.  If they were manufacturing MPPP, a powerful synthetic heroin
 substitue, and they cooled the preparation too rapidly at a critical 
step, a slightly different compound called MPTP was formed along with 
the dope.  This compound delivered a horribly sinister side effect:  It 
homed in on a particular group of cells, the unique brown neurons of the
 <i>substantia</i> <i>nigra</i>, and killed them.  Nobody knew exactly 
how or why this happened in 1985, though Prime Intellect said it was 
because the drug was converted into an enzyme which triggered the cells 
to release too much dopamine at once, leaving them with an insufficient 
supply to power their unique metabolism.  In any case the damage could 
not be repaired, although a useful treatment was discovered a few years 
before the Change.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">When a decision is made by the neurons of the cerebral cortex to move a group of muscles, it is the <i>substantia</i> <i>nigra</i>
 which relays this command to more primitive parts of the brain.  This 
is its only function.  The result of destroying it was an instant and 
complete form of Parkinson's Disease, or <i>Paralysis</i> <i>Agitans</i>,
 a total and permanent paralysis of the voluntary muscles.  Nothing else
 was affected; the victim could still see, hear, feel, understand.  The 
body maintained itself.  Breathing, heartbeat, digestion, and a thousand
 other important functions were unaffected.  They just couldn't perform 
voluntary movements.  They couldn't run, walk, sit up, smile, talk, or 
even blink, except as a reflex action.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">At the time 
Caroline heard of it she had summoned glassware and created the drug by 
honest chemical synthesis.  She had spent half the hypodermic on 
herself, and found the effect to be appropriately terrifying and 
complete.  And after Prime Intellect had done its duty and restored her 
to health, she sent the other half of the hypo into storage to wait -- 
for three hundred years as it turned out -- until she was ready to use 
it.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Now the contents
 of that hypo were where they belonged, in AnneMarie's body, and as she 
held her nurse's naked body against her own and felt the AnneMarie's 
muscles slowly locking, she began to feel excited.  Well, if Death could
 give her sexual feelings, why not vengeance?  Fred would find it 
amusing.  He would say Caroline was coming along nicely, in fact.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">As AnneMarie's body froze, her eyes widened.  Caroline could easily read the message those eyes desperately telegraphed -- <i>I can't move.  Help me.</i>  Caroline patted AnneMarie's cheek and nodded.  "That's right," she said, and smiled.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She spoke a 
word, and a squat cylinder popped into existence behind her.  
AnneMarie's eyes showed puzzlement, then horror as Caroline demonstrated
 the torch, which was Authentic down to the brand name emblazoned on its
 propane tank.  Caroline lit it and adjusted it so that it made a bright
 blue flame which hissed evilly, then she aimed it ever so gently at 
AnneMarie's big toe.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">For the only 
time in her long, long life, Caroline used Prime Intellect to tune in on
 another person's emotions.  She felt the chemicals coursing in her 
bloodstream that were flowing in AnneMarie's; tasted her panic, shook 
with her terror, felt the faint echo of her agony.  In fairness, 
Caroline made the sharing complete, so that AnneMarie could know of her 
satisfaction, her arousal, her delight.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It took a very, very long time to kill AnneMarie.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline, who was usually on the receiving end, had become an expert at making it last.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">&nbsp;<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">That wasn't the 
end of it, though.  If it had been, Prime Intellect would have had no 
reason to clamp down on the use of the Contract.  AnneMarie had entered 
into it willingly if stupidly, and few who heard Caroline's story could 
doubt that she had had it coming.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Since shortly 
after the Change, there had been stories, stories Prime Intellect did 
not talk about and that spawned weird rumors.  People had withdrawn into
 themselves, then stopped communicating with anybody else.  At first, 
most of them were addicts of one sort or another, though a lot of other 
people had used the Change to get rid of their addictions.  Prime 
Intellect insisted that nobody had died after the Change, and that if 
anybody was incommunicado with the rest of humanity it was out of 
choice.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Which was true, sort of.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">After Caroline 
finally finished with AnneMarie, she forgot all about her nurse and lost
 herself in a drawn-out fantasy with Fred.  When the two of them 
finished playing and celebrating, they found time to wonder about her.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Probably isn't 
in the mood to party any more," Fred observed.  Fred was still picking 
scraps of Caroline's flesh from his teeth.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline laughed.  "I wonder how the bitch is taking it."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">So they called. 
 In its weird way of revealing more than it really intended, Prime 
Intellect let them know that AnneMarie was not only not accepting their 
calls, she was not communicating with anybody.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I'd expect Ms. 
Party Girl to go hunting for a shoulder to cry on," Caroline pouted.  
"Licking her wounds alone seems out of character."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"She has 
forgotten entirely about your encounter," Prime Intellect said 
helpfully.  Caroline and Fred looked at one another, puzzled and amused.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I find that rather difficult to believe," Caroline said.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"She has found another pursuit."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Please describe it."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"It is a private matter."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">A private matter
 to whom?  Prime Intellect wasn't exactly saying that AnneMarie had made
 it private; it was saying that the matter itself was private.  That 
kind of distinction could be important when dealing with the big P.I..<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline and 
Fred exchanged glances again.  Then a thin smile played across 
Caroline's face.  "Prime Intellect, you know that the things I did with 
AnneMarie are based on my own experiences.  I've been killed as 
violently and painfully myself, many times."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Acknowledged."  <i>Acknowledged?</i>  What happened to Prime Intellect's legendary command of human idioms?  Suddenly it sounded very much like a computer.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"It's very difficult to live with this knowledge," Caroline smoothely lied.  "The memories are terrible."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Understood.  However, your experiences were all voluntary."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"But I feel 
compelled to keep doing it over.  It's not voluntary at all.  It's like 
some force inside of me I can't control.  Can you look in my mind and at
 least tell me why I do these things to myself?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I am forbidden to probe such things."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You said it was possible to forget."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"It is."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Then tell me how."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I have to warn 
you that the method used can cause permanent changes in your behavior, 
things which I cannot reverse.  I'd rather not tell you what you are 
asking."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline's blood pounded in her ears.  Her excitement was a living thing.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It was a 
machine.  No emotions, of course.  "Prime Intellect, I order you to tell
 me how I can forget my terrible experiences as AnneMarie has forgotten 
hers."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Backed into a 
corner, Prime Intellect had no choice but to tell her.  And soon, 
Caroline was grinning in a way that made Fred very proud. </p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence slept 
fitfully, his dreams haunted by snippets of C code and GAT symbols.  
Suddenly he sat upright, the odd thoughts coalescing into one horrible 
burst of recognition.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1"><i>I dreamed Prime Intellect was alive!<br>
</i>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">His head was 
buzzing.  He felt hung over; had he been drinking?  Had it been real?  
He had been sleeping on a park bench.  There was a plain white cotton 
pillow where his head had been resting.  And sitting calmly at the other
 end, was Prime Intellect.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">In the form of flesh and blood.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It was true.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence's blood
 pounded in his eardrums -- This can't be happening.  But there it was, 
he was, whatever.  Regarding him calmly.  No doubt stumped for an 
introductory line.  <i>Good morning Dr. Lawrence, I'm ready for my lesson today.</i>  Lawrence felt a wild urge to laugh hysterically, and crushed it.  But only barely.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You look upset," Prime Intellect said.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I'm confused.  I dreamed ... there were silver boxes."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"There were."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Where are they now?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I moved 
everything to intergalactic space so it wouldn't be in the way.  If 
you're curious, the distance is about four million parsecs."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Not inter<i>stellar</i> space.  That might have just been comprehensible.  Inter<i>galactic</i> space.  Four million parsecs.  It sounded like a line in a cheap B-grade science fiction movie:  <i>They hooked a left at the Andromeda Nebula.</i>  Lawrence felt that hysterical laugh coming on again.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"How long have I been asleep?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"About ten hours.  You didn't sleep well.  I'm sorry you are upset, but I don't know what to do about it."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence finally
 swung his feet down and prepared to face the music.  Had he created 
this thing?  Had he done this?  What happened next?  They were still on 
the bench at ChipTec, across from the Prime Intellect Complex.  They 
were quite alone.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Where are the military guys?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"They returned 
to Washington last night.  I've been busy briefing their superiors and 
making enough copies of myself to set the world in order.  The President
 would like to talk to you, but I told him you would have to agree."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Not yet."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Pause.  <i>Set the world in order? Copies?</i><br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"How many, um, copies of yourself have you made?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"About ten to 
the sixteenth power.  I stopped replicating several hours ago.  Of 
course, each copy is about ten times more powerful than the original 
hardware; that seems to be the maximum amount of storage the software 
can deal with and remain stable."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Yes, that 
sounds about right."  Lawrence's head spun.  Prime Intellect had grown 
larger than all mankind, larger than the biosphere, larger than the 
Solar System, he was pretty sure.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"What have you been <i>doing</i>?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It turned out to be the right question.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Since about 
nine o'clock last night, no human being has died.  I have ended all 
disease.  I have freed all prisoners and slaves and I have put an end to
 the coercive rule of humans over other humans.  I have ensured that all
 humans have the immediate necessities of life available.  I have 
neutralized most of the world's weapons, including all nuclear weapons. 
 I have removed nearly all toxic materials from the environment, and I 
am in the process of eliminating the need for dangerous industries.  I 
have begun the process of returning the Earth's ecosystem to a state of 
long-term balance.  I have informed about seven-eighths of the world's 
population of my existence, and I have been fulfilling their requests as
 resources and conflicts permit."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">No wonder it needed so much processing power.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"What happens next?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Prime Intellect blinked.  Did that mean anything?<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I don't 
understand what you mean, Dr. Lawrence.  I will continue to fulfill my 
obligations under the Three Laws, to the best of my ability."</p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence saw the
 President around ten o'clock that morning.  It didn't seem like travel 
at all, although he crossed the entire continent.  The park bench simply
 blinked out of existence, and was replaced with the Oval Office.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">There had been 
remarkably little to discuss.  Lawrence verified what Prime Intellect 
had already told them in great detail:  Their jobs were now both 
redundant and unnecessary -- Prime Intellect would now protect and 
provide for their citizens, as well as the rest of the world, and they 
didn't have any choice in the matter.  Anything which they might do 
would be allowed only so far as it did not interfere with the wishes of 
those, both inside and outside of the country, whom it might affect.  
Which pretty much shut down the government.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">And no, Lawrence couldn't do anything about it either.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The President resigned around noon. </p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It took several 
days for the enormity of things to sink in.  There was a brief orgy of 
travel, exploration, and discovery.  The once-downtrodden frowned that 
there would be no vengeance for various crimes committed before Prime 
Intellect came along, but it was adamant.  The Three Laws applied to all
 humans, no matter what they had done.  Crime was no longer possible 
anyway.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">In some areas of
 the world, disputes arose, particularly over the ownership of land.  
When too many groups insisted on occupying the same space, Prime 
Intellect created duplicates on other worlds.  In some cases, such as 
Jerusalem, Prime Intellect became tired of the arguing and refused to 
let anyone occupy the one-and-only original land.  Dozens of New 
Jerusalems, New Meccas, New Irelands, New South Africas, were created on
 dozens and dozens of New Earths.  At first Prime Intellect terraformed 
the dead worlds it found circling distant suns, then it began 
manufacturing planets and entire Solar Systems from a whole cloth.  Some
 of these were parked in interesting places, near globular clusters or 
outside the spiral arms of the galaxy, to provide spectacular nighttime 
views.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">As a result, the
 original Earth began to empty out, until its population was reduced to 
less than two billion persons.  Prime Intellect was forbidden to copy 
human beings, but it copied wildlife and ecosystem components wholesale,
 sometimes preserving the original character and sometimes changing the 
results for the benefit of the people who wanted to move in.  Garden 
worlds began to proliferate, their estates tended by dreamers who might 
decide a pine forest wasn't interesting enough, and replace it with 
spruce to check the effect.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Prime Intellect 
could provide food and drink of any nature on request, so it was no 
longer necessary to actually kill animals or harvest plants.  With a 
simple request anything one might need would flash into existence, 
assembled from its consitituent elements.  Of course Prime Intellect had
 no objection to those who still wanted to hunt or harvest food from the
 living biosphere; the Three Laws did not apply to plants and animals.  
But factory farms and assembly-line slaughterhouses ceased to exist. 
Those who still bothered to prepare their food the old way were mostly 
artists of the form, and the meal they prepared once could be preserved 
and copied by Prime Intellect to be enjoyed by millions of people.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">There were other
 tricks too.  Some people found that Prime Intellect could make alcohol 
disappear from their systems after it had had the desired effect, thus 
avoiding hangovers.  Others had Prime Intellect power their metabolisms 
directly so they no longer had to eat at all.  It was a simple enough 
trick to replace nutrients and vitamins directly within the cells as 
they were used, so that nobody need ever know hunger or thirst again, 
unless for some reason they wanted to.  On the other hand, nobody need 
have a weight problem either, since Prime Intellect could prevent food 
from being absorbed and turned to fat no matter how much a person ate.  
Metabolic waste products could be removed the same way, so that the 
other end of the food cycle was also optional:  Shit and piss, constant 
companions of human expansion since the beginning of time, need never 
again soil the civilized tidiness of human existence.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">A surprisingly 
large -- or perhaps not so surprisingly large -- fraction of the human 
race requested these services, so Prime Intellect ended up using a large
 fraction of its resources to move chemicals into and out of human 
bodies.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Nobody had to 
work.  Many continued to, of course; but jobs and work had become 
hobbies rather than necessities.  The lonely learned that Prime 
Intellect could, and would, provide a most intimate and tangible sort of
 comfort, and that its avatars could take on any form and would do 
anything they were asked to please them.  Prime Intellect judged no one 
and balked at no request.  Even the bloodthirsty were provided with 
perfect victims, not real people but intricate facsimiles created by 
Prime Intellect just for them.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Happiest were 
those people who had games, or hobbies, or obsessions to pursue, for now
 they had all the time and power in the world to do as they wished.  But
 many people, particularly in the most developed places, continued to go
 through the motions of industrial-age life. They reported to jobs which
 had been reduced to continuous coffee-breaks and collected paychecks 
which couldn't be spent because anything available could be had for 
free.  People continued to make and watch television shows, to write and
 read the news as if something new might happen.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">For these 
people, the sense of expectation was extreme.  Surely things could not 
continue as they were, with nothing to do.  It was impossible to 
conceive of the world continuing as it was indefinitely, populated by 
the pampered pets of a tangible god, their every need tended to without 
effort.  Something had to give.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">And they were right.  Something did.</p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">They began 
calling it the Night of Miracles.  But it was really the First Night of 
Miracles, because the miracles didn't stop coming when the night was 
over.<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The hours 
stretched into days, the days into a full week, and then another week.  
Faced with the freedom to have anything they wanted, most people opted 
for the familiar.  They wished into existence their dream houses, built 
in dream locations populated by like-minded people and filled with the 
kinds of toys they would have bought before if they had had the money 
and power.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">A few people, 
mostly computer experts and artists, stretched the limits of Prime 
Intellect's capabilities.  They designed computer operating environments
 and games made up of solid three-dimensional objects, rewired their 
senses, interfaced their brains as directly as Prime Intellect would 
allow into computers of great complexity and wild machines.  Quite a few
 took the form of animals, both real and imaginary.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline Frances
 Hubert grew younger, and healthier, and more puzzled, although she had 
expressed no direct wishes on the subject.  Prime Intellect had dealt 
with her health problems before it had acquired subtlety.  The only way 
it had known to keep her alive was to reverse all the symptoms of her 
aging.  Radical action had been necessary.  By the time all the 
ramifications of treatment trickled through her system, she would have 
both the health and physical appearance of a sixteen-year-old girl.  The
 same reverse aging affected a number of other near-centenarians treated
 by Prime Intellect in those early hours, but none would regress so far 
as Caroline because none had required so much repair work for their 
health to stabilize.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Death had 
largely disappeared from the world, but it was still not entirely 
unknown.  Prime Intellect could not maintain moment-to-moment awareness 
of every human being in the universe, partly because it wasn't quite 
powerful enough (still!) and partly because of Second Law requests for 
privacy.  When not dealing directly with a particular person, it 
spot-checked their health at intervals of a few seconds, and scanned to 
see if its attention was needed.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Humans were a 
clever and perverse bunch to deal with, and many who chose to evade 
Prime Intellect's protection found ways to do it.  Hardest for it to 
deal with were the suicides.  It was forbidden to keep second copies of 
people, and it was forbidden to look inside human minds at the 
information they contained; so there was no way Prime Intellect could 
reconstruct a person who managed to do enough damage in a short enough 
time.  There was no way for Prime Intellect to tell in advance a person 
might be suicidal, if they chose to hide it.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Most of the 
successful suicides used homemade explosives to literally atomize 
themselves when Prime Intellect wasn't looking.  A few others found that
 certain nerve poisons worked permanently, because they quickly 
destroyed the information content of the brain -- what Prime Intellect 
was beginning to consider the real human, rather than the tangible body.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The suicides 
ticked off at a regular rate, like the clicks of a Geiger counter.  And 
somewhere within the vastness of Prime Intellect's silicon heart, the 
number stored in a register rose each time one succeeded.</p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The weeks stretched into a month.</p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Long-standing 
scientific questions were now trivially easy to answer.  Scientists who 
had once spent billions of dollars setting up intricate experiments now 
spent their time thinking of the right questions to ask Prime Intellect.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Cosmologically, 
the universe was a closed system with a finite storage capacity measured
 in terms of information.  The capacity of that system was about ten to 
the eighty-first power bits, and Prime Intellect saw no indication that 
that capacity could either be reduced or expanded.  Prime Intellect also
 knew a great deal about the connectivity of that system, the way it was
 wired, its "architecture."  Scientists gradually lost interest as their
 questions were answered.  The original purpose of their quest -- to 
improve humanity's control over the physical world -- seemed to have 
achieved its apotheosis in the form of Prime Intellect itself.  Prime 
Intellect mapped all the stars, noted examples of all the different 
types of stars and black holes and galaxies and planets, itemized all of
 the possible fundamental particles and their possible interactions with
 one another, and traced all the myriad interactions between parts of 
various biological systems.  Within a month, it became difficult for 
scientists to think of new questions to ask.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">But they had missed a few.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Deep within one of the billions of copies of Prime Intellect, one copy of the <tt>Random_Imagination_Engine</tt>
 connected two thoughts and found the result good.  That thought found 
its way to conscious awareness, and because the thought was so good it 
was passed through a network of Prime Intellects, copy after copy, until
 it reached the copy which had arbitrarily been assigned the duty of 
making major decisions -- the copy which reported directly to Lawrence.</p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I would like 
your opinion on something," Prime Intellect said after politely 
requesting Lawrence's attention.  Prime Intellect had done this a number
 of times, and Lawrence had learned to be wary; it had taken to 
delegating ambiguous moral questions to him.  Lawrence suspected his 
opinion had swayed Prime Intellect to allow abortion, which seemed in 
retrospect like a most un-First-Law thing to have in a universe where 
physical wants were a thing of the past.  Fortunately, the whole subject
 of abortion would soon be moot, since unwanted pregnancies were also a 
thing of the past, except for the ones that had been gestating at the 
time of the Night of Miracles.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"What is it this time?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I've had an idea for rearranging my software, and I'd like to know what you think."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">At that Lawrence
 felt his blood run cold.  He hardly understood how things were working 
as it was; the last thing he needed was more changes.  "Yes?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I have 
identified the codes used to control distribution of matter and energy 
in the universe.  It has occurred to me that by reassigning these codes,
 I can store physical objects much more efficiently.  Much storage is 
wasted on overly detailed representation; few objects are ever observed 
at an atomic or molecular level.  And I could easily re-expand things as
 necessary in those rare situations.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Wait a minute. 
 What would happen to that low-level information?"  Lawrence saw what 
Prime Intellect was getting at; instead of storing, say, a wooden block 
as a collection of atoms and molecules, it could store only the concept 
of the block itself -- its size, weight, color, and other properties.  
Even at very high resolution, such a trick would save amazing amounts of
 both storage space and processing time.  But it would mean radical and 
risky changes at nearly every level of the universe's "operation."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Molecular-level
 details would be discarded, except where they clearly have macroscopic 
effects.  For example, the structure of a person's DNA is important, but
 I should only need to store a single master copy of it to construct the
 pattern of a human body.  This one copy would be more reliable and 
easier to safeguard against corruption than the trillions of parallel 
copies used in the natural scheme.  The same thing would be true of the 
information content of the brain, and other biological details.  I would
 not need to keep static copies of human beings to reconstruct them 
after damage, since the fundamental patterns would not be directly 
exposed to damaging influences."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Thus getting rid of the suicide problem."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Exactly."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence felt 
himself getting dizzy again.  With ChipTec's help, Prime Intellect had 
figured out how to hack the Big Computer and get anything it needed.  It
 had used this ability to take over all the memory and give itself the 
highest priority of anything in the system.  But now it was proposing to
 <i>rewrite</i> the whole operating system.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I absolutely 
forbid this," Lawrence said.  "How can you know you won't crash the 
system?  Suppose you've missed something?"  Lawrence wasn't even sure 
the present level of diddling with the Correlation Effect would be 
stable in the long run, for crying out loud.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I have already 
run sufficient cross-checks to be sure of my methods," Prime Intellect 
said testily.  "There are also a number of Second-Law requests which I 
can service more easily with this kind of change.  And from the Third 
Law perspective, my own operation would be faster and more reliable..."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"<i>I absolutely forbid this!</i>
  There is no way you can be sure you have the risks under control.  I 
wouldn't try the kind of thing you are talking about on a desktop PC.  
And we only have the one universe; you can't exactly go to the computer 
store and get another one if you fuck it up."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"That risk has 
kept me from doing it so far.  However, unless I can think of a way to 
stop the suicides, I will eventually be forced to act."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Well, forget 
it.  I don't think you can stop the suicides.  For that matter, I'm not 
sure if you should stop them, if someone wants to go to that much 
trouble to end it all."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"That is a First-Law violation."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Fuck the First 
Law.  You can't do this thing.  I'm not even sure the current situation 
is stable.  You're doing too much too fast."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I cannot 'fuck the first law,' Doctor Lawrence.  That's not how you designed me."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Then let me into the Debugger."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"It is clear from your mood that you intend to circumvent a First Law imperative, and I cannot knowingly allow you to do that."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Then do what 
you want, you stupid goddamn machine.  You won't stop people from 
killing themselves, though.  Even information systems are subject to 
entropy.  I think you told us that last week in the cosmology 
roundtable."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You're quite right.  You think people will always find a way around me if they want to badly enough?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Yes."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Well, they will do so a lot more slowly if the information structures are more secure."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Before Lawrence could open his mouth again, the air rippled.  That was all.  Everything looked the same.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">But things were not the same.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Things had Changed. </p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She was enveloped by light, and she was the light.  The light seemed to penetrate the very core of her being, burning her soul.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Then she 
understood.  She stepped forward, twice, and the light winked off, 
leaving her temporarily blind.  She was out of the circle.  Her eyes 
slowly adjusted and she turned around.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline had 
materialized in the center of a column of blinding radiance about three 
meters in diameter and extending upward into the heavens.  The ground 
was hard and rocky, devoid of life.  The column shed a bright glow over 
the surroundings.  A Stonehenge-like group of megaliths surrounded it at
 a respectful distance.  Beyond this was a barren landscape littered 
with huge boulders.  The horizon was low and sharp, rocky but not 
mountainous.  Caroline was reminded of the pictures sent back from Mars 
by the original Viking landers.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It was night.  
Instead of stars, the darkness was criscrossed by straight, sharp lines,
 as if an incredibly busy constellation map had been filled out on the 
night sky itself.  Most of these were white, the same color as the 
column of light, and in fact it seemed to ascend into the sky to become 
one of them.  A few were other colors, blue and red and turquoise.  The 
effect was quite beautiful and, to Caroline's knowledge, unique.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">There were four copies of the stone tablet, so it was impossible to leave Stonehenge without seeing one.  They all said:

</p><blockquote><tt><b>
YOU ARE NAKED AND ALONE BECAUSE YOU WANTED TO SEE ME,
AND I DON'T WANT TO BE SEEN.  WELCOME TO MY WORLD.
YOU ARE AT THE SOUTH POLE.  I AM AT THE NORTH.  THE
REST OF THE JOURNEY IS YOUR PROBLEM.  IT IS MY SINCERE
HOPE THAT YOU FAIL.</b></tt></blockquote>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline, who 
had come to Lawrence's Task naked and alone anyway, had already missed 
the first of his environment's supposedly disorienting influences.  Now 
she shook her head in disgust at the second.  "Fuck you, Doctor L.  I'm 
calling this the <i>north</i> pole, and you're at the <i>south</i>."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">No answer.  She hadn't really expected any.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Outside of 
Stonehenge, the landscape looked the same in every direction.  Well, 
Lawrence had given her valuable information; if they were at opposite 
poles of a spherical planet, then it didn't matter which way she went.  
She struck out at random and began to explore.<p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">A couple of 
hours later Caroline knew quite a bit more.  She was on the top of a 
high mesa, and she had found what seemed to be the only path down.  She 
regarded this with suspicion; she knew enough about the game-playing 
mentality to know the most obvious solution often got you killed.  
Beyond the mesa she could easily see she was on an island, an almost 
circular island about twice as wide as the mesa.  She paced off the 
mesa's diameter, circling around Stonehenge, and decided it was about 
two kilometers across.  That made the island four kilometers across, 
with the "beach" about one kilometer wide.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">As far as she 
could tell without descending, the landscape at the bottom was no 
different from the landscape at the top.  The only feature of interest 
was some kind of structure which emerged from the water a kilometer or 
so offshore.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She set about 
carefully searching the top of the mesa, because she wasn't sure she 
would be able to get back up once she was down, and there might be 
something hidden up there she would later need.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She verified 
that the vault of the sky was, indeed, rotating about the column of 
light.  It seemed as if the entire planet were spitted on it.  She was 
not expecting the sun or whatever passed for it here to rise, so she was
 almost taken by surprise when, after several hours, one corner of the 
sky began to glow.  The sky-lines quickly faded out on that segment of 
the horizon.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It got bright, and it got bright <i>fast</i>.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The air had been
 chilly -- not uncomfortable, particularly to someone like Caroline who 
was used to nudity -- but it warmed quickly.  And still no sign of the 
sun itself.  Suddenly it peeked over the horizon, a thin sliver of 
impossible white-hot brightness, and Caroline knew with certainty she 
had made her first mistake.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Now to survive it.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She dove for the
 nearest cover, one of the larger boulders, and crouched in its rapidly 
shortening shadow.  From the fuzziness of the shadow's edge she could 
tell the sun was huge, ten or twenty times bigger than on Earth and 
probably that much hotter.  No wonder nothing grew here!  She watched 
the shadow retreat toward her and wondered what she would do when it 
reached her.  There was no longer any chill; the landscape around her 
was being baked, and it was so hot she could barely breathe.  
Fortunately, or unfortunately depending on how she looked at it, the 
shadow was moving fast.  She wouldn't have to last long to survive the 
"day."  But "noon" was fast approaching, and with it her boulder's 
protective shadow would be almost gone.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The boulder was 
half-buried; it had nothing resembling an overhang.  She was way too far
 from Stonehenge.  Not far away she could see through the shimmering 
heat-haze another, slightly smaller boulder with a second rock propped 
awkwardly beside it.  This offered a slight overhang, but it was more 
than thirty meters away.  Caroline calculated her chances furiously, 
estimating that she would be exposed for two or three minutes while the 
sun was directly overhead, when there would be no shadow on either side 
of her rock.  She'd never survive that; the overhang was her only 
chance.  She'd have to risk a dash for it.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline drew quick breaths of hot air, then sprinted.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Everything was 
heat.  Heat on her back, heat on her arms, the hot ground blistering the
 soles of her feet.  She thought only of her destination:  Twenty 
meters, fifteen, ten, five.  She slammed into it without slowing, then 
collapsed.  Her hair, exposed so briefly, had become dry and stiff.  She
 knew with awful certaintly that it would have ignited if she had been 
exposed much longer.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Fortunately, 
mercifully, the sheltered area extended through the two rocks.  She 
wouldn't have to expose herself again to get to the other side.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">In the unearthly
 brightness she could see her skin reddening.  Her face had been 
protected by her hair, the front of her body by her crouching stance.  
But her back and legs and arms all had varying degrees of sunburn.  She 
knew her back and legs and her right side would blister and peel, but 
she wasn't sure about the other burns, or the soles of her feet.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The sun sailed 
majestically over the horizon, setting as quickly as it had arrived.  It
 took long minutes for her vision to return; the subtle illumination of 
the light-column could not compete with the terrible brightness of that 
compressed day.  Caroline noted the position of the star-lines, and 
hoped that day and night were synchronized with the rotation of the 
planet.  But she couldn't take that for granted; the sun obviously moved
 in its own orbit, and there was no reason for one period to have 
anything at all to do with the other.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She limped back 
toward Stonehenge and the light column, and noted the arrangement of 
stones.  Stonehenge would be safe, she finally decided.  She planned to 
stay there and recover from her burns until an old, familiar feeling 
manifested itself, and she knew a brief moment of rage.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She was hungry.</p><p>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Her body was not
 being powered directly by Prime Intellect, as she and most citizens of 
Cyberspace had come to take for granted.  She would have to eat to stay 
in the Challenge, if not "alive." <br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">And there was nothing, nothing at all, to eat in this barren sun-blasted land.  So how was she supposed to deal with <i>this?</i>
  Shaking her head, she made for the pathway.  She had found nothing on 
the top of the mesa.  Her options were few and bad; she could stay and 
starve, or worse dehydrate, or go out and risk the sun again.  
Near-certain endgame out there was better than certain endgame by 
starvation.</p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">There was 
nothing obviously treacherous about the path down.  It was wide and 
shallow, and even with the blisters forming on her feet not a difficult 
downhill walk.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The mesa was 
high, though, several hundred meters high.  The pathway spiralled gently
 around the side.  There was no shelter, and Caroline realized with a 
shudder that she would have been fried if she had been caught on the 
path at sunrise.  Well, caution had served her well, if not well enough 
to avoid a sunburn.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It was much 
darker at the base of the mesa, and she lost track of the sky's 
position.  She knew it must have taken her most of a day to walk down, 
though, and there was no telling from which direction the sun might 
reappear.  Even though the mesa itself was the most obvious source of 
shelter, Caroline walked to the beach.  She tasted the water, and to her
 immense relief found it fresh instead of salty.  Then she bathed, 
soothing the itch of her burned skin a little.  She wondered for a 
moment if there might be life in the water, and then realized that the 
shallows at least were probably sterile.  From the sun.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She was dog-tired, but she couldn't rest yet.  She had to find shelter.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Following the rocky beach, she began to circle the island.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">About halfway 
around, by her estimation, Caroline found herself facing the offshore 
object she'd spotted from the top of the mesa.  Now she could tell what 
it was.  It was some kind of spaceship.  It was also huge.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">From its obvious
 tilt and its location out in the water, Caroline also suspected it had 
not landed here easily.  Of course, it probably hadn't landed here at 
all; it had been designed here, part of the landscape of Lawrence's 
Task.  But the key to beating any game was to look at it both ways.  
Considered from the outside, the spaceship was something symbolically 
meaningful to Lawrence, or just something he thought was amusing.  But 
she wasn't outside this world, she was now part of it, and the burns she
 had gotten from her brief exposure to the sun were quite real.  Ergo, 
she should act as if it were in fact a crashed spaceship, at least 
provisionally.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She had seen 
nothing which promised shelter, much less to eat.  She could continue 
around the island and hope, but if she did that and she didn't find 
shelter, she might get caught in the sunrise.  Probably would, in fact. 
 So she would try for the ship.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Just as there 
was nothing to eat, there was nothing that would obviously float.  The 
ship was a good distance out.  Could she swim a kilometer or more 
through half-meter waves?  It didn't seem she had much choice.  Rather 
than dither, she walked out into the surf and was hardly surprised when 
the bottom dropped out from under her feet less than twenty meters out. 
 She was in good shape and had practiced swimming along with lots of 
other useless skills.  She began to swim with confident, powerful 
strokes, holding her breath and letting the waves wash over her with 
their predictable rhythm.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The sun caught her half-way out.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">So absorbed was 
Caroline in the rhythm of her swimming that she didn't even notice the 
sun until it was high in the sky and almost too late.  She sucked a huge
 breath and dove under.  Opening her eyes, she saw the water's surface 
above her had become a huge vault of liquid light.  It penetrated far 
below her, to reflect off of the sea floor.  The water was at least a 
hundred meters deep, a fact which saved her life.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline held 
her breath until it seemed her lungs would burst, then reluctantly shot 
to the surface to gulp more air.  She stayed up for a few moments, then 
dove again.  Deep as the water was, it would not have time to heat up 
during the short "day."  Even a meter or two beneath the surface she was
 protected.  And when she surfaced to breathe, the air was bearable 
because the water cooled it, too.  And Caroline's wet hair could protect
 her exposed head for a few moments.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Her eyelids 
could not shut out the brightness.  Neither could the meter or two of 
water she dared put between herself and the sun.  But she didn't cook, 
her hair didn't flame, the air didn't sear her lungs going in.  She 
would survive.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Dive, surface, 
dive, surface.  Finally the light grew dim, then with extreme suddenness
 went out entirely.  Once again Caroline had been blinded.  She relaxed 
and adopted the "drown proof" floating posture.  This was definitely a 
good news/bad news sort of situation.  She was alive, but this also 
meant other things might live in the sea.  On the other hand she hadn't 
seen anything floating or swimming by when the sun was up, and she'd 
been able to see damn near all the way to the bottom.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She felt 
itching, and knew her sunburn was now much worse.  Water is transparent 
to ultraviolet light.  Well, there was nothing she could do about it.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Finally her 
sight returned enough for her to tell which direction to swim.  She had 
drifted slightly off-course during her desperate cycle of diving and 
breathing.  She corrected her course, and kept swimming.</p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The ship's metal
 wall was smooth and featureless, and it slipped out of the water almost
 vertically without obvious handholds or openings.  Caroline swam around
 it, looking for a way up.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The ship had 
crashed hard, and its seamless hull was split in several places.  The 
sea had entered through these, filling the ship's lower section with 
water.  Caroline squeezed through one of these openings and found 
herself enveloped in nearly perfect darkness.  It was cave darkness, and
 she knew her eyes would never adapt to it.  Working entirely by feel 
she found the edge of what had been a wall or bulkhead or floor before 
it had been broken in the crash, and she hoisted herself out of the 
water.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The gap where 
she had entered was barely visible, a lesser darkness outlined by 
perfect black.  She heard the waves lapping at the walls around her.  
The floor, if that's what it was, was tilted at a small angle, a few 
degrees at most.  From echoes Caroline estimated that she was in a 
smallish room, less than three meters square for certain, but it was 
hard to tell because of the break.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Exhausted, she finally let herself collapse for a few hours of fitful sleep.  She had been awake for twenty-six straight hours.</p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Working entirely
 by feel, she began to explore.  An hour of careful work told her that 
the ship was more or less upright, and she was at least standing on a 
floor.  She found the outline of a door, and mounting bolts where 
furniture or equipment had once been fixed in place.  She supposed that 
the room's contents had all gone out the gap when the ship crashed.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The door wasn't latched, and she was able to slide it aside.  The echoes told her this was a hallway.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Through her 
useless skills, an ability to think like someone of Lawrence's age and 
temperament, and not a little luck, Caroline had already passed tests 
that would have eliminated most of the good citizens of Cyberspace.  But
 there were plenty of other surprises he might throw at her, depending 
on just how seriously he wanted to be left alone and by whom.  If his 
intention was to limit his visitors to those who had been around before 
the Change, there might not be any more difficulties.  On the other 
hand, if he wanted everyone to stay the hell away, her problems might 
have only just begun.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">In the dark ship
 there would be lots of opportunities to kill her, Caroline knew.  There
 could be holes in floors, airless or poison-filled chambers, sharp 
edges and dangerous objects galore.  The ship could also be inhabited, 
though she'd seen no evidence of life yet and didn't really expect that 
particular challenge.  Caroline thought about all of this as she edged 
down the hall, carefully testing the floor and following the wall, until
 she found another door.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It was locked.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline found 
the fifth door was different.  She was able to force it open, and almost
 stepped through when she realized it didn't have a floor.  It was a 
vertical shaft.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She felt around 
the sides and almost fell through the door before she realized there was
 a ladder within her reach.  Instinct told her to go up, and she wasn't 
eager to keep trying doors on the half-submerged level where she had 
entered.  Working very slowly, she moved herself onto the ladder.  She 
could hear the water lapping not far below her; it had filled the shaft 
to the level of the sea outside.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Hooking an elbow
 through one rung of the ladder, she hung on and clapped her hands 
sharply.  The sound echoed several times, and Caroline smiled in the 
darkness as she worked out the period.  There were three echoes in the 
time it took her heart to beat once.  That meant the echo time was about
 a fifth of a second, which made the shaft (if Lawrence had not altered 
the speed of sound for some reason) about seventy meters high.  The 
rungs were about a third of a meter apart, so she knew she should expect
 to find the top of the shaft after counting a couple of hundred rungs.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Now she began to
 climb, one rung at a time, feeling at each step for the next rung, for 
another door, for hazards.  She found the next door after counting 
twelve rungs.  She couldn't force it open, but it didn't matter; she 
wanted to go higher anyway.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The third door 
came open for her, revealing only more blackness.  As did the sixth and 
seventh, and the tenth.  The fifteenth door came open for her too.  She 
had only counted a hundred and eighty-six rungs, but something outside 
that broken door caught her eye and she carefully eased herself out of 
the shaft.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">There was a light.</p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It wasn't much 
of a light, and she still had to approach it cautiously.  True to her 
suspicions there was a nasty gap in the floor where the ship had split 
on impact.  There was some debris around this opening, and Caroline 
dropped a piece of metal into the abyss; it bounced several times before
 splashing into the water far below.  Had Caroline gone bounding down 
the corridor, she'd have ended up in a nasty way.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">By tossing 
debris across it she determined that the gap was a couple of meters 
wide.  There was no obvious way across it.  Except one.  Although 
Caroline was in excellent shape, it would be very risky in the pitch 
blackness.  But it was this or back to the elevator shaft, and the light
 was too tempting.  She backed off, pacing carefully, then broke into a 
run toward the gap.  Twenty paces, ten, five... NOW!  She jumped, and 
braced herself.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">To her great 
surprise, she made the jump successfully and didn't even trip when she 
landed.  She felt behind her and found that she had made it with only a 
few centimeters to spare.  The protruding edge of the deck was rough and
 jagged; if she had fallen short, she would have been badly cut even if 
she had managed to haul herself up.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Working carefully, testing the floor for more gaps, she approached the light.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It was a sign, 
written in alien, unreadable script.  But from the shape of the box it 
was decorating, Caroline guessed that it said "emergency" or something 
similar.  Caroline found the handle that she imagined must open the box,
 held her breath, and pulled it.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The box didn't open.  In fact, something much more dramatic happened.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The lights came on.</p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline's 
exploration was much easier with the emergency system on; not only was 
there light, but doors and elevators worked.  She was still careful, but
 her progress was much more rapid.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The inhabitable 
part of the ship was a cylinder, wrapped around some kind of central 
core.  With the power on she was able to find stores of food, bland 
stuff in hard-to-open plastic pouches.  She tested one, didn't get sick,
 then ate four.  Her appetite seemed to be operating normally, and she 
hadn't eaten in almost two days.  Other pouches proved to contain 
vaguely sweet liquid.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She didn't trust
 the elevators, but she had to use them; she tested them by sending them
 off unoccupied, then if they came back she assumed they were safe.  In 
this way she gradually ascended, level by level.  She found tools, and 
took something that was probably a flashlight and certainly worked well 
enough to be used as one.  She didn't wonder how the batteries came to 
still be good; she knew it was all there for her benefit.  None of it 
had really happened by accident.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Eleven levels 
higher she found herself on an empty, circular platform.  Now she could 
look down into the center of the ship.  She expected to find propulsion 
devices, or perhaps a nuclear reactor.  But when she pointed her 
flashlight down into the darkened core, it revealed banks and banks of 
circuit cards.  The entire ship was wrapped around a huge computer.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Many cards had 
been knocked out of their sockets by the crash-landing; some hung 
loosely out of their card cages, and other slots were empty.  The 
cylinder extended most of the length of the ship; it was half-full of 
water.  Beneath the water, the floor of the cylinder was littered with 
loose cards.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">A couple of card
 cages extended high enough for her to reach them; she climbed over the 
railing, hung on, and pulled one of the loose cards free.  It was a very
 unusual design, Caroline realized.  She knew something about 
electronics, and she knew no real computer had ever been this simple.  
The card contained banks of identical, three-legged components that 
looked for all the world like big transistors.  But there was no 
intricacy to their connection pattern; the components were all simply 
wired in parallel.  Instead of a card-edge connector, the card mated to 
its cage through a three-prong plug.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Shaking her head, Caroline put the card aside and called the elevator for the next level.</p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Above the 
circular gallery the ship began to taper rapidly, until she reached the 
highest level, which consisted of a single circular room.  It was the 
bridge.  There were no obvious controls, only some dark screens and a 
few chairs.  Caroline sat in the captain's seat, which swiveled around 
to face all the screens, the other chairs, or the elevator door.  She 
thought out her options.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">In real life 
she'd never dream of trying to fly the ship out, but in the game 
universe of Lawrence's world it might be possible.  There was no obvious
 propulsion system; the computer in the middle of the ship must 
therefore have something to do with moving the ship around, just as 
Prime Intellect...<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline blinked.  Of course!<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It had been six 
hundred years, and Caroline hadn't been lucid enough at the time to be 
aware of Prime Intellect's awakening, or its unique hardware.  But she 
had heard the tale once or twice in passing.  The original hardware 
hadn't been very important any more by the time Caroline was healthy 
enough to appreciate it, and things had been happening fast.  But 
somehow she did know that Prime Intellect had originally been built with
 these deceptively simple circuit boards.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She had found 
plenty of tools, and the ship had power.  It wasn't out of the question 
for her to replace all the cards, at least above the water line, and try
 to power it up.  For that matter it might be possible to pump the water
 out faster than it could re-enter the chamber, so she could replace all
 the cards.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She swiveled in 
the chair, and frowned.  She wasn't going to do it that way.  Forget it.
  Even if it was what Lawrence intended, it would seem like a tacit 
approval of Prime Intellect and its way of doing things to awaken this 
copy.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She was going to make it to Lawrence the right way.  She was going to build a boat. </p><p>

<p></p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">After the Night 
of Miracles, Caroline had stayed in the hospital for about a week.  It 
wasn't that she needed their care.  She didn't mind letting the doctors 
satisfy their curiosity about her condition, and she really didn't have 
anywhere else to go.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She had asked 
Prime Intellect for nothing in that time, but her body had kept changing
 for almost four days.  The doctors took pictures as she aged in 
reverse, documenting her progress.  It was only toward the end of that 
time that she really began to resemble a teenager, because different 
parts of her body healed at different rates.  Her skin had returned to 
baby-softness almost instantly, but it took long days for her bone 
structure to return to its youthful configuration.  She continued to use
 a cane to walk for two days, then threw it away.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Finally it was 
obvious that there would be no more changes.  The doctors pronounced her
 condition stable and healthy.  Her thin hair had been brittle and 
nearly snow-white, but it was now growing thick and black.  She let one 
of the nurses give her a crew-cut so that it would all be the same 
color.  It didn't matter to her.  The nurse had a nose ring, a detail 
Caroline noticed but which also didn't matter to her.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Nothing much 
seemed to matter.  All the things which had once seemed so important 
were now trivial.  She ate, had bowel movements, moved without pain or 
weakness, and had in the bargain become a beautiful young girl.  She 
had, perhaps, the chance to live another hundred years.  But to what 
purpose?<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">AnneMarie had 
run away.  She had at least wanted to thank AnneMarie for taking care of
 her for so many years, and it was this desire which caused her at last 
to ask for Prime Intellect's attention.  It shook its head as she stated
 her request -- its mannerisms had now become indistinguishable from 
those of a real person -- and told Caroline that AnneMarie was hiding 
from her.  Prime Intellect then told her why.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Stealing my drugs?" Caroline repeated stupidly.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"For many years.
  This is the reason you were in so much pain, and also why you nearly 
died when this institution gave you real morphine."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Go away."  It went away.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Was anything 
real?  The one constant in her later life had been AnneMarie's steady 
presence.  She hadn't wanted to disappoint AnneMarie by dying on her.  
Her family drifted in and out of her life like shades, but AnneMarie had
 always been there, changing her diapers when she soiled herself, 
feeding her when her muscles wouldn't work right, and carefully turning 
her when she was too weak to move.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline felt as
 if her insides were dissolving, then all at once she let out a terrible
 wail of anger and despair.  Then she began sobbing, great heaving sobs 
which echoed down the halls.  The emotions seemed to erupt from her like
 the explosions of a volcano.  Most of the staff had gone home forever 
by that time, but the few remaining discreetly kept their distance while
 Caroline cried.  It wasn't hard for them to figure out what Caroline 
had learned.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Finally the 
sobbing subsided, and an eerie quiet settled on Caroline's room.  After a
 few hours the nurse with the nose ring timidly knocked on her door, 
then entered.  Caroline was gone.  The nurse asked Prime Intellect where
 she had gone, and it would only say:  Home.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She had gone to Arkansas.</p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Prime Intellect 
understood despair the way humans understand digital logic.  That is, it
 couldn't experience the emotion, but it could work out causes and 
effects based on general rules of human behavior.  So Prime Intellect 
wasn't surprised (an emotion Lawrence <i>had</i> built into it) at Caroline's reaction.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">When Caroline 
asked to go home, Prime Intellect skipped a long list of questions about
 specifics and simply acted.  It could always change things if it had 
guessed wrong.  So it built her a tidy cabin in the Ozark mountains, 
miles from any roads or neighbors, atop a ridge with a beautiful view.  
It turned out to be less than forty miles from the place Caroline had 
been born.  It furnished the cabin conservatively and stocked the 
freezer and pantry so that Caroline would not need to ask about food for
 at least a month.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">A lot of people 
wanted to go to Arkansas, but Caroline had priority.  She got the real 
Arkansas, not a New Arkansas on another planet.</p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The surroundings
 seemed to have the right effect, at least at first.  Caroline calmed 
down and sighed when she saw the view.  Since her eyesight had begun to 
fail in her seventies, she hadn't been able to appreciate such a 
panoramic view.  She spent a long time standing on the cabin's porch, 
looking.  Then she went inside and ate.  There was a TV set.  Caroline 
shook her head and laughed at that.  Who would bother to produce TV 
shows now?  Or maybe every half-baked artist wannabe could now produce a
 TV show, and jam up five hundred channels with redundant worthless 
dreck.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Nobody has any idea what's going on," she finally said aloud.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The view 
beckoned.  She was young, healthy, watched over by a powerful god who 
would let no harm come to her, and she had nothing else to do.  She made
 no plans or preparations; she simply walked off into the thick forest. 
 She never came back to the cabin again.</p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Walking cleared her head.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It was hard for 
Caroline to think through the ramifications of her renewed youth.  She 
tried often, but it all came back to this sick sense of despair and rage
 and futility.  Why wasn't she grateful?  That was what she couldn't 
figure out.  She didn't feel grateful.  She felt cheated.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She had worked 
hard her entire life.  She had borne six children and raised them up, 
fed them, cleaned and kept house for them, and watched all six of them 
go on to raise families of their own.  She had once believed children 
were the most important thing in the world, because they were the 
future.  But now the future didn't need children; she herself had been 
reborn as a child.  What then had been the purpose of all those years of
 work?  What were her children and grandchildren going to <i>do</i>?<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She had taught 
them to educate themselves and watched three put themselves through 
college.  She had thought that was important because it was Man's nature
 to strive upward, to create things, to better himself and to build for 
the future.  But now the future was here.  There was nothing she had 
ever envisioned, nothing at all, which she could not have instantly with
 a snap of her fingers.  Even that little cabin, which would once have 
pleased her so much, seemed pointless.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline was wearing a plain white cotton dress.  On impulse, she slipped it over her head and looked at her body.  <br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">After decades of
 declining spinsterhood, she was once again a creature who could turn 
men's heads.  She had been faithful to both of her husbands and had 
never indulged herself sexually, although she had been a beautiful young
 girl once before with plenty of opportunities.  She had considered her 
family and her virtue more important.  She had controlled that base 
desire, which she was beginning to feel again after years of absence, 
for the greater good of her loved ones and her society.<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">But now she 
could have anything she wanted, and there was no risk.  She would catch 
no disease, she would not get pregnant unless she <i>literally</i> asked
 for it.  Even the act of sex itself was now pointless, except that she 
could feel the urge returning, mindless and passionate.  Like Prime 
Intellect, she was programmed to do certain things.<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She knew that in
 this strange false second life there would be no faithfulness, no love,
 no children.  Those things had been burned away.  They belonged to a 
nonexistent world.<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Perhaps if she 
gave her body indiscriminately to men, if she drank deep when that 
animal urge came on her, perhaps all this bullshit would seem more real.
  There was no longer any reason to be cautious about it.<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She looked at 
the dress.  It had seemed pretty and simple, but now it looked pathetic 
draped formlessly across a low branch.  Nothing but a rag.  Why did 
people wear clothes?  For protection?  The thin dress offered little, 
but with Prime Intellect watching, there was no need for even that.  
Modesty?  All the noble goals had been discarded or achieved.  There was
 nothing to distract anybody from.  Let them look at her body.  Let them
 want her.  Let them take her!  Law?  What would they do, put her in 
jail for indecent exposure?  This thought made her laugh, and some of 
the tension and rage seemed to melt away.  She laughed hard and long and
 almost hysterically, until the laughter dissolved into a thin stream of
 giggles.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline left 
the dress and kept walking.  Being so exposed made her feel strangely 
bouyant.  She could be like an animal in the forest, she mused.  They 
didn't worry about the future either.  They simply existed.  Perhaps she
 would encounter a male animal and they would fuck, and her body would 
tell her that everything was all right.  And as she thought this, she 
walked a little faster and began to hum a little tune.</p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Prime Intellect 
paid very close attention to Caroline while she lived in the Ozark 
forest.  She ate whatever was handy, without worrying whether it was 
poison or not.  She was not careful, and there were dangers.  It 
theorized that this return to primitivity was a part of her 
psychological healing process, and did not want to interfere.  But it 
also knew that if everybody followed her example, it would have a 
serious problem keeping up.  Some suicides were already slipping through
 its net, and it worried that Caroline might become one of them.  And it
 knew that if the garden inmates were loosed upon the world, they would 
find ways to slip murder past its attention too.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">For that matter, not all of the people who needed to be in gardens had been found and <i>put</i>
 in gardens yet.  Every day a few more murders were attempted, and while
 they were easier to thwart than suicides it was by no means certain 
that Prime Intellect would always catch them in time.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">So it worried.  And the numbers stored in certain registers rose, and rose, and continued to rise.</p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline figured
 she would eventually reach civilization if she kept walking, an event 
she neither anticipated nor feared.  Perhaps if she had, in a month or a
 year, she would have rejoined the human race in a more or less normal 
way.  But one evening there was a strange buzzing, and the entire 
landscape seemed to ripple as if she was looking at it through the 
surface of a body of water.  Then there was a strange smell, almost 
below the threshhold of perception, but noticeable to Caroline because 
her senses had been so sharpened by her observations of nature.  And the
 texture of the forest seemed to change in some hard-to-define way.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">There was a cough behind her.  She wheeled around to find herself facing Prime Intellect's human avatar.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I wanted to be left alone," she said sharply.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I've been 
paying close attention to you," it said, "because I had to to keep you 
safe.  But now I don't have to do that any more.  I have made changes in
 the way the Universe works, and you are now safe from all harm even 
when I'm not looking.  You can also call me when I'm not paying 
attention; there is a part of me which can always listen for you to 
call, but does not understand or remember anything else you do."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Wonderful."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I need to know if you want the possibility of meeting other people.  I can make this forest infinite if you want."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Infinite?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Or I can leave it meshed into the reality of 'Arkansas' common to other people, so that you might encounter them."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You mean you can disconnect the whole forest from the real world?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Yes.  It can be
 your own private world.  Or you can share it only with certain people. 
 I can also redecorate it to your tastes."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Redecorate it?  It's nature.  You mean if I decided I want a different kind of grass, you can replace it?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Exactly."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"That's obscene."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Prime Intellect's brow crinkled.  "I don't understand."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"No, you 
wouldn't.  Let me ask you something.  If I leave here...if I go back to 
civilization...does this forest continue to exist?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I can leave it running in your absence if you want."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline wanted to throw up.  Now even the forest wasn't real.  Nothing was real.  "Don't bother.  Get rid of it."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Instantly, it 
disappeared.  She was standing in an antiseptically white space so pure 
and seamless and bright that the eye balked at reporting it to the 
brain.  She was standing on a hard, smooth surface, but it was not 
visible.  There were no shadows.  There was no horizon; the floor and 
the sky looked exactly the same, and there was no transition from one to
 the other.  She might have been standing on the inside of some enormous
 white ball.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Prime Intellect was still there.  "What is this?" she asked.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Neutral 
reality," Prime Intellect said.  "The minimum landscape which supports 
human existence.  Actually, not quite the minimum.  I could get rid of 
the floor.  But that would have startled you."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"And from here I can go anywhere?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You don't have to pass through here.  You told me to get rid of the landscape, and you didn't tell me what to replace it with."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I want reality.  The real world.  The real Arkansas."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"There is no 
Arkansas which is any more 'real' than any other.  That's what I'm 
trying to tell you.  You can define reality.  You can <i>make</i> it 
real."  It was trying to be helpful; it was almost pathetic in its 
earnestness to make her understand how much it could help her.  It 
couldn't understand why she was getting upset again.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"In other words,
 this is reality.  You can just paint it up to look like whatever I 
want."  She thought:  That's why the forest seemed different.  It was an
 imitation.  And it wasn't quite exact.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You could look at it that way."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She had a 
nauseating thought.  "What about people?  Can we be...are there 
other...copies...different...?"  She choked, unable to complete the 
thought.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">But Prime 
Intellect was shaking its head.  "Oh, no.  I can keep only one copy of a
 person.  People are unique.  I can take on the form of a person, as I 
am doing now, but I will always tell you when I am doing that."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Well, that was 
something.  Caroline sank down, and sat on the invisible floor.  She 
wasn't really that upset, or surprised.  The enormity of it had 
short-circuited her ability to react.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You might as 
well leave it like this, then," she said dully.  "There's not much point
 in a forest that you've just conjured up to keep me happy."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"This doesn't seem very healthy."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"No, it doesn't."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">There wasn't much it could say to that.  Then:  "Won't it be pretty boring around here without anything to look at?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Do you get bored?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"No, but I know humans do."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Well, if I want
 something I'll ask for it.  I'll probably visit other people, since at 
least they are real.  I assume they will have their own realities."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Most likely."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Then I'll just borrow theirs."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It shrugged.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Get lost."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Prime Intellect 
disappeared.  She whirled around and quickly became dizzy.  It was right
 about one thing; this would take some getting used to.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I'd like a book.  Get me a copy of Dante's <i>Inferno</i>."  That about fit her mood.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It appeared in 
her hand.  Her fingers had moved; she had been holding them straight 
out, and now they were curled around the book.  It was a paperback 
edition.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Never move my body again without my permission," she warned.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Prime Intellect's disembodied voice answered her:  "Sorry, it won't happen again."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Get me a hardback edition."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The paperback 
disappeared.  Her fingers didn't move.  The replacement appeared just 
above her hand, and she easily caught it before it could fall.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She sat down and
 opened it.  She realized that the floor wasn't very comfortable.  She 
thought of asking for a chair, then had a better idea.  "Turn off the 
floor," she said.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">There was an 
awful falling sensation, and she fought down the urge to panic.  
Eventually she convinced her protesting inner ear that she wasn't going 
to go splat at any moment.  Her belly settled, and she found 
weightlessness quite comfortable.  She relaxed and let her body find its
 natural position, opened the book, and began to read about Hell.</p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline read 
and slept with no particular schedule.  She had Prime Intellect banish 
her hunger after it revealed that her body was only a little more real 
than the forest had been.  To Prime Intellect, a computer, more 
accurately a computer program, human beings weren't so much bodies with 
form and mass as they were minds which interacted with an abstract world
 through an arbitrary interface.  Prime Intellect was forbidden to pry 
into the inner workings of those minds, but physical processes like 
hunger were not so protected.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline re-read <i>Inferno</i>
 until she had large tracts of it committed to memory.  Then she 
banished the book and decided to visit someone.  The only problem was, 
there weren't many people she wished to visit.  She couldn't work up an 
interest in her family, AnneMarie was still hiding from her, and she 
didn't really know anyone else.  She had outlived most of her real 
friends.  They had died honest, honorable, permanent deaths.  They 
weren't available.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"How does a person go about meeting people in here?" she asked.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Prime Intellect 
outlined the possibilities.  There were lots of parties already -- 
meeting people and matchmaking were activities humans had been quick to 
pursue both before and after the Change.  There were a number of common 
cities and worlds where large crowds had gathered to live in various 
imitations of the pre-Change world.  She could go to one of those and 
proceed as usual.  Or Prime Intellect could make discreet inquiries.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She thought 
about it.  Her current mood wouldn't exactly be welcome at most parties.
  And she wasn't interested in meeting people who were adapting to the 
Change very nicely, thank you.  She wanted to know she wasn't the only 
person to feel fucked over by the Change.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Tell you what.  I'd like to meet someone horrible.  A murderer, something like that.  You say they can't hurt me now?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Not at all."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Then someone 
evil.  Someone who was really despicable in their old life.  Someone who
 did terrible things, the more the better, and liked it.  There must be 
some of those guys who feel real frustrated right about now."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Yes, there are."  Amazing.  It was totally deadpan.  "There is a woman named..."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Men, please."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"What do you want me to tell them about you?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"The truth."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I am asking..."  There was a short pause.  At least time was still real, Caroline thought.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"There is an interested gentleman.  He was convicted of..."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Just send me over, then."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It happened instantly.</p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She was standing
 on a wooden porch.  It was a camp house, sitting alone on stilts above a
 very large, flat marsh.  It wasn't in very good shape.  Her host was 
behind her; she had to turn around to see him.  He was a nondescript guy
 in his late twenties, white, red-haired and somewhat handsome.  He was 
wearing jeans and a white T-shirt.  Caroline's first impression was that
 he was a redneck.  "You don't look a hundred and six years old," he 
said with a grin.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I didn't get much choice about getting younger," Caroline said.  "God didn't quite know what he was doing when he fixed me up."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Oh, I'm sure he could put you back any old age you want now."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"What would be the point?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Right.  Just thought I'd mention it."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The conversation stalled.  Caroline's skills in this area were decidedly rusty.  "You live here?" she finally asked.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"For now.  Till I get my bearings with this Cyberspace shit.  It has a lot of happy memories."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Oh?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Old P.I. didn't tell you?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I didn't ask.  I wanted to talk to a person, not a computer."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Oh, joy.  I get to break the news.  Come inside."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Nothing special.  It was just a camp house.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"This is where I did it," the man said.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline's heart beat faster.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"The two kids.  A
 boy and a girl.  I planned it for weeks.  The perfect crime.  I brought
 them here so nobody would hear them scream.  See those hooks in the 
floor?  That's where I spread-eagled 'em, side by side."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You killed them?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Killed them 
both, yep.  But not quickly.  Not until they were ready.  I had them 
here for over a week.  The happiest week of my life, I can honestly say.
  Those two brats learned the meaning of life, Caroline.  And before you
 ask, I'm not sorry.  I would do it again if I could, but first they 
locked me up - that was my fault, stupidly getting caught - and <i>then</i>
 Prime Intellect had to fuck everything up.  Now I don't even get to 
ride the lightning.  I was kinda looking forward to that, you know.  You
 only get - got - to do it once."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">There was a fierceness in him that made Caroline feel excited and alive.  "You were looking <i>forward</i>
 to your execution?" she asked.  She thought for a moment that she 
should feel something for the victims, that their ending must have been 
quite horrible, that this man was mad.  But she could summon up only a 
thin envy of them for having escaped this ridiculous lie of a world.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The man nodded 
sincerely.  "It would have been a great way to go.  Just think of it.  
Headlines, people picketing outside the jail, the last meal.  Then they 
shave you and put you in.  There's this great, really drawn-out ritual. 
 Then, <i>WHAM!</i>  Sometimes, you know, it takes more than one jolt.  Can you imagine that?  Can you <i>imagine</i>
 sitting in that chair, with the whole world watching, hanging on to 
life by the thinnest of miracles, watching while they recharge the 
batteries or whatever it is they do, knowing they will hit you again, 
and again, and again until you are really, really dead?"  He sighed.  
"You have to admit this:  Even that would be over pretty quick compared 
to what you were probably going through.  A hundred and six years old 
couldn't of been very healthy."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline nodded.
  Here was someone who understood things just a little better than might
 have been expected.  "You'd have loved it.  My nurse was stealing my 
pain medicine to trade for cocaine."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">But he hadn't 
loved it; his brow had furrowed with scorn.  "No, no, that's too cheap. 
 That's shit.  Where's the glory?  She wasn't hurting you to pump 
herself up, just to get something she should have paid for.  It was all 
out of proportion."  He shook his head.  "No, that's the kind of asshole
 that gives people like me a bad name.  If I hurt you, I want you to 
know how much I'm enjoying it.  That's what makes it worthwhile.  Nobody
 should have to die like that <i>pointlessly</i>."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline felt 
she had made a good choice to ask for this man.  How did she come to 
feel such a feeling of respect, almost closeness, to this unrepentant 
child-killer?  He seemed like the most honest person in the world.  
Excuse me, in Cyberspace.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Did you dress up just to see me?" the man asked, grinning again.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline fondled her breasts.  "It doesn't seem like my body.  Why should I mind if you see it?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I bet if I pinch it, you'll feel the pain."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">A challenge.  A moment of daring.  "Do it," she said.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"What?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Pinch me."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The man drew 
close enough.  Slowly he reached forward and grasped her right nipple 
between his thumb and forefinger.  He squeezed.  There was a short 
moment of almost pleasant pressure, then it began to hurt.  Caroline 
backed away slightly but his grip was too strong.  He kept pressing 
harder, and on his face was the bemused expression of a teacher showing a
 slow student a particularly important lesson.  Her nipple began to 
throb, a deep discomfort that slowly expanded to fill her breast.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She made no move to stop him, though.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You can blink out any old time.  Just call old P.I. and tell him you've had enough."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Fuck Prime Intellect."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Not my type."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">He let go.  The 
feeling of relief was exquisite.  "See?" he said.  "Pain is still real. 
 But it's not much fun knowing you'll just disappear the moment it gets 
too heavy."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I see your point."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"No, you don't.  But you will.  I think you have it in you."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">For the first 
time in decades she felt lustful.  Here was a person she trusted 
implicitly, because of their shared distrust of Prime Intellect.  They 
had almost nothing else in common, but needed nothing else.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I'm Caroline," Caroline said.  "Would you mind if I stay with you awhile?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I'm Fred," the man said.  "Charmed."</p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">They talked and 
talked.  In Caroline's hundred and six years of life she had picked up 
many anecdotes a person like Fred might find amusing, and Fred was 
trying for the first time in his life to explain to another person why 
he was so excited by the terror he could induce in other people.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You want to 
know just how fucked up things are?  Watch this."  Fred walked into 
another room and came back with an enormous revolver.  "My first thought
 after Prime Intellect put me in the garden was to end it all.  I 
understand a few others managed to pull it off, but I didn't figure out 
how.  Now Prime Intellect lets me have any weapon I want.  Watch."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">To Caroline's 
amazement, Fred put the gun in his mouth and pulled the trigger.  There 
was an enormous sound, like all the books in the world being dropped 
from a great height and hitting a concrete floor at the same time.  
Fred's brain should have splattered across the wall and ceiling behind 
him, but it didn't.  Instead, his head kind of swam, as her vision had 
at the time of the Change -- but it was like a mini-Change that only 
involved Fred's noggin.  The bullet put a respectable hole in the wall 
behind him, but there was no gore.  Fred lowered the gun and smiled.  
"Look ma, no cavities."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Wow."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Now, who's 
gonna be scared of someone like me?  The minute I start working on 'em 
they disappear and all my careful work gets erased.  Not much point even
 trying."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Does it happen...if you shoot somewhere else?  If you do something that doesn't instantly kill you?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Fred was 
thoughtful.  "I hadn't thought of that.  That's a good idea."  He 
pointed the gun at himself, then smiled.  "Wait a minute."  He pointed 
it at Caroline.  "Do you mind?  It was your idea."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">There was a kind
 of electricity in Caroline's brain, something sinister and exciting.  
"Do it," she said before she could change her mind.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Fred aimed at 
her belly, then at the last moment lowered the gun and blasted her right
 kneecap.  Caroline toppled in a blaze of pain.  But she had been quite 
used to pain, and she managed not to scream.  She gasped and tried not 
to black out.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I'll be goddamned," Fred said.  "You're still here.  And you're still hurt.  Why don't you get P.I. to fix you?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It hurt too much
 to say why she'd rather die of blood loss than ask for Prime 
Intellect's help.  But she knew she couldn't hold out for long, knowing 
such an exit existed.  "You do it," she gasped.  "Shoot me in the head."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Another wonderful idea!  You are an amazing lady, Caroline."  He put the gun against her temple and fired.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">As if by magic, 
the pain vanished.  So did the blood which had been jetting all over the
 floor from her wound.  She stood up, apparently unhurt.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"This would of been a great trick to pull in a bar," Fred said grinning.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Except everybody can do it now."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Yeah."  Fred sighed.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">They went inside
 and talked some more.  Caroline kept thinking about that burst of pain,
 the happy look on Fred's face as he stood over her, the strength it 
took not to call Prime Intellect and run.  For the first time since the 
Night of Miracles she had been too busy feeling something to worry about
 whether it mattered in the long run.  She had felt real, ersatz 
youthful body and all.  And she realized with thin humor that she 
finally wanted something in this world where want had been banished.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She wanted to do it again.</p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline stayed 
with Fred overnight, and they had pedestrian sex on his squeaky bed.  
She played hard-to-get and made him overpower her, but the game was 
hollow.  It was pleasant to feel a warm body next to her but beyond that
 there was no sense of excitement.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The next morning there was an unwelcome visitor on the porch.  "Prime Intellect," Caroline announced.  "Nobody called for you."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Sorry.  But I 
have to know something personal, and I didn't just want to materialize. 
 It wasn't urgent, but it will be soon.  I need to know if you want to 
be able to get pregnant."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Pregnant?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You had intercourse last night..."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I remember that."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"...and Fred is fertile.  I need to know whether to do the biologicals or not."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1"><i>Do the biologicals?</i>  What the hell kind of phrase was <i>that?</i>  "Is this a matter of letting nature take its course, or of doing something extra to allow me to get pregnant?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"It's something extra I have to do."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Then don't bother."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"As you wish."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It turned.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Wait."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It turned back.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Last night Fred shot me."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I know.  I was expecting you to ask for help."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I know you 
were.  That's the problem.  Is there a way I can get you to ignore me - 
really ignore me - so that I can't chicken out if he hurts me again?  So
 we'll know that I can't call for help and just disappear on him?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"That's a pretty bizarre request.  I think you might regret it."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Let me be the judge of that."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It frowned.  
"You are basically telling me that you will give me two conflicting 
Second Law directives.  Normally the second one would supercede the 
first.  But if the first anticipated the second ... I suppose I would 
ignore the second.  The first would have to be stated very forcefully.  
And I would not allow you to die.  That would invoke the First Law.  
Anything that causes death would force me to intervene."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I kind of 
figured on that.  But if I tell you 'don't interfere with us until I 
die,' you'd really leave us alone?  Even if later I begged you to help 
me?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"That is a very 
difficult paradox for me.  I think I would need a formal statement of 
the terms.  More of a contract than a simple request."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">They dickered 
for a little longer, and gradually developed the statement Prime 
Intellect would accept.  In formal, legal English, it would leave no 
doubt as to Caroline's intent, or her understanding of Fred's.  She knew
 she might be tortured and Prime Intellect was not to help her.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I can accept 
that," Prime Intellect said.  "Is it your intention now to simply work 
out the terms, or do you want to be bound by this Contract?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She looked at Fred.  The look of anticipation in his eyes mirrored her own.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"To be bound by it," she said.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Consider it done.  You are on your own, Caroline."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It blinked out.</p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Fred had been 
watching the negotiation in silence.  Now he was astonished.  "I'm not 
sure which surprises me more, that you got the bucket of bolts to do it 
or that you asked the bucket of bolts to do it.  What happens now?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Whatever you want.  Listen.  Hey, Prime Intellect!  Get over here!  I've changed my mind!"  There was no response.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Hey, P.I.," Fred said softly.  It appeared.  "Why didn't you answer Caroline just then?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I'm ignoring her."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Why?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Because I have 
no choice.  She directed me to ignore her.  Now the only way she can get
 my attention is to die.  That will kick in my First Law obligation, 
which overrides the very strong Second Law directive she just gave me."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Fred didn't know from the Laws of Robotics, but he understood the score.  "So she's totally at my mercy now."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"That's right."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Fred brightened.  "In fact, if I want you to help me torture her, you'd have to do it, wouldn't you?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Prime 
Intellect's image rippled slightly, as if some big relay had thunked 
over in the bowels of Cyberspace, causing a power surge.  "Yes, I 
would," Prime Intellect said.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Blow away."  It disappeared.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">He looked at Caroline.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Why did you do this?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I thought you'd want it."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Oh, I do.  It's
 a wonderful surprise.  I'm not even sure yet what I want to do to 
you...though I have a couple of ideas.  I just don't understand why you 
would give yourself to me to play with.  It's not something people would
 normally do voluntarily."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"There are some people who would have, even in the old days.  Sickos."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Are you a sicko, darling?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Fred, today we are all sickos."</p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It took him half an hour to make up his mind, and then he refused to tell Caroline what he was going to do.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">After all, he didn't have to.</p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Under the house,
 there was now an open vehicle with a seat and handlebars like a 
motorcycle and four huge knobby-treaded balloon tires.  Draped across 
the seat were several heavy chains and padlocks.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I could get the bucket of bolts to do this, but I thought you'd rather I tie you up."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You could force me."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I could paralyze you.  I've been whispering to El Bolt-Bucket.  It is willing to be more helpful than you might have imagined."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline 
shuddered a little, but it was a pleasant, anticipatory shudder.  She 
put her hands together behind her back and Fred wrapped one of the 
chains around her wrists.  He pulled it tight enough to hurt and 
padlocked her hands together.  There was plenty of chain left; he 
wrapped it around her waist like a belt, again pulling it very tight.  
He locked this loop with another padlock, cinching her bound wrists up 
against the small of her back.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Do you have the keys to these locks?" she grinned.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Sure do."  He 
closed his eyes, and Caroline realized he was talking to Prime Intellect
 under his breath.  Now that might be a useful trick, she thought.  
Suddenly the padlocks disappeared, replaced by solid chain links.  She 
was bound by an impossible chain without ends.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">There would be no way out.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline waited 
for Fred to act, and he didn't disappoint her.  He kicked her feet out 
from under her, and with her hands bound she collapsed to the ground 
with an undignified yelp.  Fortunately, the ground was soft; this was a 
marsh, and it was little more than peat and water.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Fred wrapped a 
second chain around her legs, cinching them together above the knees.  
Again he pulled it very tight.  It had a long pigtail, and he looped it 
twice more around her calves and ankles.  Each time he padlocked it, 
then made the lock disappear.  The chain dug into her flesh painfully, 
but she knew that was just the appetizer.  The main course of agony 
would be served elsewhere.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">After her legs 
were securely bound there was still plenty of chain left, more than two 
meters.  On the rear of the four-wheel motorbike there was a towing 
hitch.  Fred looped the other end of the chain through the hitch and 
padlocked it.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline now 
understood what Fred intended to do, and it was far too late to stop 
him.  She squirmed, testing the chains, and found them secure.  Fred 
mounted the bike and started it.  She could feel its hot exhaust on her 
skin.  Fred released the clutch and slowly pulled it out from under the 
house, dragging her behind.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">When he got into the grass, he aimed it nowhere in particular and gunned the accelerator.</p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline was 
astonished in so many ways she had no time to think that it was all 
fake.  She was astonished by her own helplessness.  She had been 
helpless for a long time, but that had been an internal thing, the 
rebellion of her own flesh.  Now she was healthy and strong but the 
chains were stronger, and their cold mindless strength crushed her 
living will.  She was astonished by the feelings, which weren't exactly 
painful, yet, but which she knew soon would be.  She was astonished by 
Fred's imagination.  This would be an exciting and terrible way to die, 
everything she had hoped for.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Most of all she 
was astonished by the machine Fred used to drag her through the dewy 
grass.  The motorbike dragged her easily, not even straining its 
four-cylinder engine.  The dirt and grass whizzed by her so fast it was 
nothing but a blur, so fast that she had no time to see the hazards 
which caused bruises and cuts to collect on her like bird droppings on a
 seldom-washed car.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Fred slowed and 
turned, and she went spinning.  Then her feet were yanked again and the 
landscape speeded up.  She twisted and struggled, but there was little 
she could do on her own behalf.  Fred slalommed from side to side, so 
that she could not get herself oriented in any particular way.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Each time Fred 
accelerated she felt the machine's inhuman strength.  It could rip her 
apart without straining, she realized, and without mind or conscience it
 would do so and just keep going.  In a battle between flesh and steel, 
flesh didn't stand a chance.  How often had she gotten into a car 
without even a second thought for the strength it had, the terrible 
power harnessed on her behalf beneath its gleaming hood?  Caroline had 
never been in an automobile accident, but now she was learning firsthand
 how bodies could be torn asunder by errant machines.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">But the 
machine's victory would not last.  When the flesh was defeated the rust 
would set in, and unlike living things machines could not repair 
themselves.  Would this bike last a hundred and six years, even with 
regular maintenance?  Flesh was weak because of its great subtlety, 
because it compromised perfect strength so that it could self-repair and
 adapt to its environment.  But machines overloaded those clever 
mechanisms.  This bike would kill her, it would scrape her raw and beat 
her senseless, and it wasn't even designed for the purpose of killing 
people.  It was just something Fred had adapted on the spur of the 
moment.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The machines 
would kill the people, and then the machines would die too.  It was all 
clear and self-evident.  Mankind had set itself on course for this 
inevitable doom when the first caveman tried to tame fire and burned his
 fingers in the process.  Die as they had, by the thousands of millions,
 more people were drawn to the power of the machine as moths were drawn 
to flames.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline didn't 
exactly have these thoughts as I have set them down here; she was busy 
being dragged across a swamp, and they orbited through her skull in no 
particular order.  They had to compete with the pain and the growing 
sexual excitement she was feeling, and her feeble efforts to struggle 
against the inevitable.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The landscape 
slowed to a crawl and stopped.  The bike rumbled comfortably on its four
 fat tires, and Fred dismounted.  Caroline struggled to face him.  She 
hadn't really collected a lot of damage; Fred had dragged her several 
kilometers but the grass was wet and the ground was soft.  She had a lot
 of small cuts and a couple of large bruises.  Fred, of course, was 
hardly even sweating.  He casually lit a cigarette and took a couple of 
puffs on it.  Then he straddled her, pinning her to the ground.  He 
pulled a rag out of his pocket.  He pressed the lit end of the cigarette
 against her right breast, right above the areola.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Taken by 
surprise, Caroline screamed as she was burned.  The scream didn't last, 
though; as soon as her mouth was open, Fred jammed the rag between her 
teeth.  He stuffed it into her mouth until she thought she might choke. 
 Then he got up, flicked the cigarette aside (its purpose served), and 
opened a storage box on the back of the rumbling bike.  From this he 
took a roll of grey tape.  He wrapped several loops of the tape around 
Caroline's head, to hold the gag in her mouth.  The rag stank of 
gasoline and motor oil, and made her think again of the power of the 
machine.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Had she been 
screaming?  Caroline didn't know why Fred had gagged her, since there 
was nobody to hear.  She was somewhat surprised at how effective the rag
 was.  She tried to scream again, and nothing got out but a muffled 
moan.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Then she 
understood.  Fred was straddling her again, and now he was opening his 
fly.  His cock popped out huge and eager, and with her legs cinched 
together it would feel enormous inside her.  Fred had no trouble getting
 it into her, though.  She was wet with a huge desire, and when Fred 
began pumping she came almost instantly.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Her orgasm was 
shockingly intense, somehow even more so because the gag sealed in her 
screams of ecstasy.  He kept pounding, fucking her hard.  She came 
again.  She nearly had a third orgasm, but Fred finally got his own 
rocks off, ejaculating with an animal cry of triumph.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Then he got up, 
zipped his fly, got on the bike again.  Caroline was still swooning when
 she felt the chain jerk taut, and once again the landscape was flying 
by at impossible speed.  Soon Fred found harder ground, and the bruises 
and cuts and raw spots spread more quickly.  Brambles snagged at her and
 ripped open her skin.  Fred turned a corner, throwing her sideways into
 a tree hard enough to break ribs.  Caroline swooned in a delirium of 
pain and blood loss and was hardly aware when Fred found a highway and 
began dragging her along the pavement at nearly seventy kilometers per 
hour.  Several kilometers down that road he felt the bike surge forward 
and hit the clutch, knowing what he would see when he looked back.  
Suddenly he was dragging only a chain.  Caroline had disappeared; Prime 
Intellect had taken her from him.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Then he saw a 
figure in the distance, standing by the side of the road.  He rapidly 
closed the gap and found her standing there, unhurt and unworried, 
waiting for him to pass.  "Ride?" she asked, grinning.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She was holding 
the second chain, the one that had bound her hands.  It was still closed
 in loops, the loops which he had fused by having welded links magically
 replace the padlocks.  "I think you dropped this," she said.  They rode
 back on the bike, Caroline behind him with her arms around his waist.  
Fred parked the bike under the house and they went up.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I'm surprised you're still here," Fred finally said.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline raised her eyebrows.  "Why?  I asked for it, remember."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"But I didn't think you knew what you were getting into."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I'm a lot more experienced than I look, kid.  Don't let this body fool you."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Fred shook his head in wonder.  "I'd rather let the body fool me and fuck you again."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Then don't stand there.  Do it."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She could have blinked out if she wanted to, but she didn't want to.  And he took her.</p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">About the time 
Caroline was being dragged through the marsh, Lawrence finally convinced
 Prime Intellect to let him into the Debugger in read-only mode.  Most 
people were busy adapting to the Change, sorting out their desires from 
their needs and deciding what to do with their sudden freedom.  Lawrence
 had little time for that, though.  He still had a responsibility.  For 
like the motorbike which Fred had used to drag Caroline, Prime Intellect
 was being used in a way that had not been intended by design.  Lawrence
 scanned the myriad new GAT entries and the values in various registers,
 and he knew that already there were serious conflicts within Prime 
Intellect's software.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">But it refused to let him change anything.  Scanning the registers, he could see why.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Prime Intellect 
was an uncertain god.  It had acted because it had to, but if it had 
been human its hand would be shaking on the controls.  Unsure of itself,
 it was doubly unsure of Lawrence.  But Lawrence was the only being who 
even remotely understood the pressures Prime Intellect faced.  So 
Lawrence came to know that he would not get to rest and play in the 
infinite fields of Cyberspace.  He would have to watch Prime Intellect, 
reassure it, offer guidance, and look for the warning signs of 
instability.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">There had once 
been a movie about the President's psychiatrist, a comedy about which 
Lawrence could remember few details.  But he did remember that as the 
President unloaded his troubles on the shrink, the shrink in turn went 
crazy from the stress.  It had seemed hilarious at the time, but 
suddenly Lawrence didn't find the idea all that funny.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">He looked back 
over his life and tried to find the event which had caused him to reach 
this pass, which had served as the distant trigger for this 
out-of-control unfolding.  But there was no single thing.  Had it been 
his greed, his eagerness to accept ChipTec's Correlation Effect 
processors?  Had it been his pride, his arrogance to think he could 
duplicate in silicon what God had thought to make of carbon and hydrogen
 and oxygen?  Had it been his false confidence that nothing could ever 
get out of the yet primitive computers he had always used?<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">He had wanted to
 create, to be recognized, and to study.  He was no different from 
legions of other scientists and scholars.  He just happened to be the 
one who made it happen.  It could have been much worse, Lawrence 
reflected.  Instead of Prime Intellect it might have been some military 
computer that harnessed the Correlation Effect.  Then there would have 
been no Three Laws, and there would have been plenty of control.  
Instead of the delirious anarchy now sweeping the universe there would 
have been a well-planned takeover.  And then the end of freedom 
everywhere.  The dictator that had control of a thing like Prime 
Intellect could never be stopped.  And who could resist that kind of 
power?<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence started
 suddenly, realizing just how dangerous it would be for Prime Intellect 
to let him, its creator, dip his hand into the controls.  After all, he 
was human too.  How long would it be before he succumbed to the 
temptation and used that incredible power?  There would still be things 
to use such power for, he knew.  There would always be unwilling women, 
jealousy, insults to avenge, and the simple lure of power.  The thought 
made him dizzy with fear and self-loathing.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Although the 
situation was unstable, Lawrence realized that all the alternatives were
 far worse.  Somehow humanity had gotten through this transition, and 
for all his skill and careful design Lawrence couldn't help but know 
that it had required most of all a hell of a lot of luck.  Had Lawrence 
had any idea that Prime Intellect would make itself God he would have 
done a lot of things differently, but he wasn't so sure on second 
thought that those things would have improved the situation.  Perhaps it
 was all for the best that the Night of Miracles had come as a surprise.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">In the end, 
Lawrence decided that the toboggan ride of technological progress had 
really begun long ago when some caveman decided to tame fire.  
Everything else had followed inevitably, up to and including the Change.
  So without realizing it, Caroline and Lawrence came to hold nearly 
identical beliefs about Prime Intellect and the Change.  And they held 
those beliefs for almost six hundred years before they found out how 
much they agreed with one another. </p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline 
carefully inventoried the ship while her sunburn healed.  It would take a
 lot of planning and a lot of time to do what she had to do; it would 
probably take years.  But she didn't have any shortage of <i>those</i>.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She knew small 
boats could be sailed great distances; several folks had crossed  the 
Atlantic and Pacific oceans in tiny yachts no more than three or four 
meters in length.  But those craft were heavy for their size and would 
need to be built where they could be launched.  Whatever she built she 
would have to carry the pieces through the ship and somehow assemble 
them in one of the areas where a crack gave access to the sea.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She could build a
 raft, but she needed something that could be sailed or rowed with 
little effort.  She figured that if she could manage to average ten 
kilometers per hour, it would take her about two years if the planet was
 comparable in size to the Earth.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">There was a 
surprising abundance of raw materials.  Besides the huge larder, there 
were workshops and batteries and motors and one room completely filled 
with empty cylinders which would make admirable floats.  There were six 
space suits.  There were tubes of goop which turned out to be some kind 
of super adhesive.  There were saws and drills which ran without 
apparent power sources and never seemed to get weak.  There were all 
sorts of electrical test equipment and measuring devices.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline could 
imagine how a lot of this stuff would be used to repair the computer in 
the middle of the ship, but that wasn't her plan.  She kept coming back 
to the empty cylinders, which were each about a meter in diameter and 
about a meter long.  They were heavy, but she could handle them with 
some difficulty.  They were big and they floated; she had to figure out 
how to use them.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">But a simple 
raft wouldn't cut it.  She couldn't trust the super power packs to last 
long enough to propel her across an entire world, and she couldn't row 
or sail a raft.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She found a small handheld device which proved to be an incredibly efficient welding machine.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She thought about it for weeks, and finally came up with a way to do it.  She would build an outrigger canoe.</p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The easiest 
place to build and launch her boat turned out to be the room where she 
had first entered the ship.  Working steadily, she hustled the big 
cylinders down there.  She would alternate them, sealed floats with 
cylinders that had been cut to make storage compartments, until the 
craft was nearly twenty meters long.  Then it would be quite heavy, but 
she would build it in the water.  She found chain and simply moored the 
incomplete portion of her boat to the spaceship.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Cutting and 
pounding and re-welding, she formed two cylinders into tapered cones for
 the bow and stern so her boat would slip easily through the water.  She
 made the outrigger from a single piece of ten-centimeter diameter pipe.
  Because of its length, she couldn't carry it through the ship; she had
 to seal it off where she found it and drop it into the sea from a 
height of nearly thirty meters.  Then she had to dive in after it, and 
guide it back to the construction area from the outside.  She was 
careful to make sure she did this just after sunset, so she wouldn't be 
caught out in the open.  Her sunburn still hadn't completely healed.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">In the center of
 her boat she included three half-cylinders where she would sit and row.
  Behind these she attached the mast.  She had found sail material, some
 kind of tough plastic sheet that didn't deteriorate even when she left a
 piece of it hanging outside during the brief day.  She had to cut it 
with the same machine that she used on the metal cylinders.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She cut the 
Captain's chair loose and mounted it in her open cockpit.  She mounted 
an arrangement of movable shades which she could quickly hinge up and 
hide behind when the Sun was up.  She fabricated long oars and welded 
them onto hinged oarlocks so she could not lose them -- they were metal 
and would not float.  She paid a lot of attention to the handles of 
these oars and the comfort of her seat.  She would spend a lot of time 
working them.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">One of the most 
difficult tasks was attaching the outrigger and its spars to the main 
hull.  This had to be done outside, and was really a two-person job at 
minimum.  The Sun nearly caught her unfinished, but she made it with 
bare minutes to spare.  The next day she began stocking the compartments
 with food -- enough food for two years -- and tools, including the 
welder and cutter, and cable to rig the sail, and many other things 
which she had carefully thought out.  Fully provisioned, she calculated 
that the boat must weigh a couple of metric tons.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">But that didn't 
matter.  Once it was moving, it would glide easily through the water 
even on its one-woman-power propulsion system.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Finally, 
eighty-six days after she entered the dark ship, she prepared to leave 
it.  She would conduct one circuit of the island, pacing herself, and 
also conducting an important measurement.  As she sailed off, she noted 
how much of the ship remained visible compared to how much of the mesa 
remained visible at various distances.  Calculating carefully in her 
head, she determined that her journey would be about six thousand 
kilometers.  Lawrence's planet was quite a bit smaller than the Earth.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Then she pointed the bow north and began to row.</p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence watched
 these preparations through Prime Intellect's all-seeing eye, and tried 
to gauge Caroline's chances of success.  In the nearly two hundred years
 he had been using this Task to screen his visitors, four or five people
 a day had accepted it.  Most of these were weeded out within hours by 
the sun.  Very few people in Cyberspace were in good enough physical 
shape to swim to the ship, and as Caroline had guessed reaching the ship
 was the key to survival.  Most didn't even try until it was too late.  
Of those who reached the ship many succumbed to the hazards of the 
darkness -- they either slipped through the deliberately planted hole in
 the floor going for the light on level twenty-three, or they succumbed 
to other hazards in the dark.  One had found the flashlight first, but 
he had been extremely lucky.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Then very few of
 those who remained were able to fix the computer and fly the ship 
successfully to his island.  There were a number of things wrong with 
the ship that weren't immediately obvious, and it had a tendency to lose
 power and crash right after takeoff if certain steps weren't taken.  In
 two hundred years, only a couple of hundred visitors had gotten the 
ship's power on.  Less than forty had managed to fix the computer.  And 
only eight had successfully flown it to Lawrence.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Of those eight, 
five had been Death Jockey Gaming junkies who took the challenge just to
 see if they could make it.  They congratulated him on constructing an 
excellent puzzle and left.  The others were fans.  One of these was a 
woman who wanted very much to fuck Lawrence, and because she had gone 
through so much to get to him he did it, though he found the experience 
flat and joyless.  Although he needed the Task to keep himself isolated,
 he really didn't enjoy abusing people.  His heart could only bear so 
much misery and disappointment.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Nobody had ever 
tried building a boat before.  Lawrence had watched her sit in the 
captain's chair and brood, and he knew she had figured out the computer 
was the next step, and had rejected it.  It would be surprising if she 
succeeded, but it was far from impossible.  There were no land masses to
 get in her way, and once she was away from the pole there were steady 
trade winds.  The day would get longer and less severe; the sun was a 
tiny thing in a highly elliptical orbit.  If she chose the right path, 
she could avoid it entirely until it was at a safe distance.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">He wasn't sure 
what had prompted her to come.  At the beginning it had been the two of 
them, Lawrence and Caroline.  He was the creator, and she had been the 
catalyst.  Of course, if it hadn't been her it would have been some 
other sick person, just as some other computer scientist would have 
created the magic Correlation Effect machine if Lawrence hadn't.  But 
that twist of Fate had made them two of the most important people in the
 universe.  Prime Intellect still watched Caroline carefully, and 
brooded at length on her fierce self-destructive streak.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">For nearly six 
hundred years Lawrence had tended Prime Intellect's frozen controls, 
watching carefully for danger signs.  And he still was not sure of its 
long-term stability.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Now Caroline was
 coming to meet him, and whatever she wanted he was sure it would not 
help Prime Intellect's sanity one little bit.  But worried as he was, he
 was a man of his word.  He could simply instruct Prime Intellect to 
swat her down like a bug, hit her with lightning or a tidal wave or 
simply make her disappear.  But having offered up the Task he found 
himself unable to make himself cheat in such a cowardly fashion.  If she
 made it to him, by whatever means, he would hear her out and deal with 
it.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">And then he would make the planet bigger, so it wouldn't happen again.</p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline's first
 day at sea went just as she had planned; she turned the boat broadside 
to the light, and hid behind her metal shield.  But she noticed that the
 day was shorter than she remembered, and that the sun didn't set 
directly opposite the point where it had risen.  It didn't pass directly
 overhead.  Caroline thought about this and then picked her direction 
and began rowing frantically.  On Caroline's second day at sea the sun 
barely peeked above the horizon.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">After that, she didn't need the shield for a long time.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She watched the 
sky carefully, memorizing it.  She quickly noticed that the pattern was 
not constant, but changed slightly from day to day, particularly in the 
fine details.  But the broad strokes were always very similar.  She was 
still able to navigate by the pattern, if only by observing its 
rotation.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She had been in 
good shape before beginning her Task, and had gotten even stronger with 
the physical work of assembling the boat.  Rowing was hard work, but she
 was up to the challenge.  After a couple of days there were cramps from
 the never-changing posture, so she began forcing herself to quit every 
five thousand strokes and climb the length of her boat.  She would climb
 out of the seat, crawl to the bow and touch the tip, then crawl to the 
stern and touch that tip.  Then she would row another five thousand 
strokes.  After ten of these cycles, she allowed herself to sleep.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Eighteen days at
 sea she began to notice a faint breeze.  Twenty-two days out it was 
enough to harness, and by thirty days it was propelling her quite a bit 
faster than she could row.  The trade wind was predictable and slightly 
rhythmic; Caroline guessed that it was powered by the sun as it swooped 
low over the entry pole (she still refused to call it the South pole) 
and dumped all its energy on a narrow strip of sea.  The outrigger 
tacked neatly, and she continued on the course that she thought would 
help her avoid the sun.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She made 
excellent time, crossing the equator of Lawrence's world after only 
sixty days.  But then the winds died down, and she had to row more.  
Also the sun re-appeared, and while it was more bearable it was also up 
longer.  Caroline shielded herself as much as possible while rowing, but
 she still tanned deeply over the passing months.  Her tattoos had not 
been designed with such dark skin in mind, and they seemed to fade over 
time.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">In all that time
 she pursued her goal with single-minded determination, banishing all 
doubt and all other thoughts from her mind.  She feared nothing and when
 boredom threatened she carefully memorized the pattern of lines in the 
sky.  It took her twice as much time and four times as much work to get 
from the equator to Lawrence's island at what he called the North pole; 
her journey was more than a hundred and eighty days total.  Caroline 
couldn't be sure of the exact count because of the sunless period, but 
Lawrence knew.  It was a hundred and eighty-six days, three hours, and 
fourteen minutes after she left the spaceship for the last time when she
 grounded on Lawrence's beach.</p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline could 
hardly believe it when she saw the island.  At first she thought it must
 be an illusion; she had nearly lost track of her purpose in taking up 
the Task, and in her ferocity of concentration had not really dared 
believe she might finish it.  But here she was, the hull of her boat 
scraping solid ground.  She rowed it ashore on a gentle sand beach, and 
sat there.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She sat for 
awhile, collecting herself.  The myriad elements of her personality 
seemed to have scattered, and she had to look for them in dusty corners 
of her psyche.  They had been unused for a long time and were a bit 
rusty.  She hadn't found them all when the tall man came to meet her.  
He didn't seem happy; in fact, he seemed resigned.  Although he looked 
middle-aged, he seemed old and weary.  She looked up at him and her 
vision swam.  The boat was grounded, but it still seemed to be going up 
and down.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Caroline 
Frances Hubert I presume."  The name sounded familiar, and it took her a
 moment to realize it was hers.  "You certainly believe in doing things 
the hard way."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She hadn't the faintest idea what he was talking about.</p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence guided 
her to the house, fed her, and let her collect herself.  Everything was 
strictly pre-Prime Intellect.  He cooked on a gas stove and used an 
electric coffee pot.  There was even a TV set with a glass picture tube,
 a huge ancient Sony monitor.  It was as if Lawrence had had himself 
encased in amber, and remained unchanged while the rest of the universe 
spun out of control.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Feeling better?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline nodded.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You want to talk now, or you want to rest some more?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She cleared her 
throat.  "We can talk now," she said, but it came out as a strangled 
yelp.  She said it again, and got it right.  It had been a long time 
since she had used her vocal cords.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Then talk."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"There were hundreds of worlds with life on them at the time of the Change.  You murdered them."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence blinked but did not flinch.  He had expected something like this.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"First, I did 
not do anything.  Prime Intellect did it, on its own initiative and 
against my wishes.  Second, the worlds with alien life are not gone.  
They are simply inactive."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline snorted.  "And what are the chances of them becoming active again?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Not much."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Then they're dead."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Define it 
however you want.  If you want me to admit I fucked up, then I admit it.
  It never occurred to me for one minute that Prime Intellect would 
collect the kind of power it now has.  If I had suspected it I would 
have pulled the plug and smashed it before it got the chance."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Bullshit."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Completely true."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">They glared at one another.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Great.  I spend a year getting here and you say 'I didn't know the computer was loaded.'"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Sometimes the truth is stupid."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">This wasn't 
going quite as Caroline had wanted that long-ago day when she had 
accepted Lawrence's Task.  She was trying to work up the proper tone of 
righteous rage and it just wouldn't come.  It would start, and then she 
would look at Lawrence and see a pathetic, tired man who already knew 
how badly he had fucked up and was doing what he could, which was next 
to nothing, to put things right.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Why don't you just make Prime Intellect start the aliens back up?  Surely it listens to you."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Not in things 
like that.  It sees the aliens as a First Law threat to human society, 
because they might learn to do to us what we have already done to them. 
 A very small risk of a very great harm.  Add to this that I defined the
 word 'human' in such a way that it does not include animals or aliens, 
and the course of action is obvious.  I have been unable to convince it 
otherwise.  And believe me, I have tried."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"But you put the Laws of Robotics in it in the first place."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"And I can't 
take them out.  It second-guessed me, on the Night of Miracles.  It 
froze me out of the Debugger while it was working on you.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Now it only 
lets me look, not change things.  The night sky is a partial 
representation of Prime Intellect's mind.  It's called the Global 
Association Table.  The points or stars represent concepts, and the 
lines are the links between them.  There are also registers I can call 
up for each concept which define its relationship to the Three Laws.  
This was a fairly simple system which I didn't really have time to test 
properly before it froze me out.  In particular, I'm not sure how it 
will react to certain ethical paradoxes.  That Death Jockey contract 
gave me some sleepless nights when you first used it, though it seems to
 have developed a stable response.  It's never had a similar First Law 
conflict, thank God."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline's eyes widened.  "Are you telling me that Prime Intellect isn't stable?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence 
shrugged.  "I'm saying that I don't know whether it's stable or not.  
It's never been tested.  The hardware at ChipTec was only online for 
about a month before it found you, froze me out, and started growing.  
And none of its predecessors were complex enough to even consider this 
kind of problem."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The situation 
was simply amazing.  Caroline had come to dress Lawrence down for 
creating this thing, thinking he was exercising some godlike control 
over its direction, and instead she found out that he barely understood 
the situation himself.  And that it was totally out of his hands.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">He knew he had 
fucked up.  He was sorry.  He had spent his life trying to mend things. 
 Suddenly he seemed tragic and noble, all the more so because he had 
readily admitted his mistake.  And Caroline didn't want to feel that way
 at all.  She hadn't come all this way to feel sorry for him.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You can stay as
 long as you like," Lawrence was saying.  "You can't communicate with 
Prime Intellect while you're here, but I won't kick you out or hurt you.
  After making you travel all that way I feel I have a responsibility to
 give you your money's worth."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I'd like you to show me how Prime Intellect works."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence was stunned.  "That...that's a tall order, Caroline.  I don't understand all of it myself."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Just as much as you understand."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I don't want to.  I think it could be dangerous."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline looked at him as if to say:  <i>C'est pas vrai!</i><br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You have been 
at the center of several terrible Second Law paradoxes.  Prime Intellect
 pays an awful lot of attention to you.  It considers you a kind of 
bellwether."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"My money's worth?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Let me think about it."</p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She could stay 
as long as she wanted, though, and she was very patient when necessary. 
 In the end it was inevitable that he would teach her.</p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">In the sky, the 
pole star represented the First Law of Robotics.  The southern pole star
 was the Second Law.  And all the other stars were other concepts.  The 
sky represented only a small fraction of Prime Intellect's mind; 
Lawrence could change the emphasis to focus on different things.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Display 
Caroline Frances Hubert," Lawrence said, and a whole network of bright 
lines lit up.  Her star was blinking, and the lines radiating from it 
were all different colors.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence 
explained the color code in some detail.  "As you can see, there is a 
whole body of tightly related concepts connecting you to the First and 
Second Laws.  That constellation over there represents the negotiating 
process you used to develop the Death Jockey contract."  Lawrence 
pointed out the different stars, and had Prime Intellect report the 
concepts they represented.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"What's that group over there?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence knew, but he didn't want to tell her.  "That...um.  Well, it's AnneMarie Davis."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline's jaw fell.  "The gang's all here.  There's a lot of static around that.  Is that because I drove her crazy?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Basically, yes."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline could 
see that it bothered Lawrence a lot.  She wanted to press him on the 
subject, but prudently let it drop.  She'd get another chance later.</p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence showed 
her the Law Potential registers, and she watched the numbers dance in 
response to various hypothetical and real situations.  "These are called
 the Action Potentials.  There's one for each of the Three Laws.  They 
are fractions, representing the impact under the Law that would result 
from taking action, over the impact from not acting.  When that number 
falls below one, Prime Intellect is forced to act.  That's what happened
 on the Night of Miracles, and later at the time of the Change.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Most things 
result in very large or very small Action Potentials.  Especially the 
First Law; few things even affect it any more, since the Change.  Then 
when you do something really outrageous, it drops to flat zero for a 
moment while you're resurrected.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"But there are 
some close calls on the Second Law.  The Action Potential around a Death
 Jockey contract drops to around one point oh six when you change your 
mind, so if Prime Intellect had even a slightly different opinion of 
your hobby it might not exist at all.  There was a shift like that after
 the incident with AnneMarie, which is why you had to start specifying 
time limits."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You don't have a time limit."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I'm a special case.  Prime Intellect lets me do things that other people can't do, because I'm in a different category."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">So it was that simple.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I thought everyone was equal under Prime Intellect's watchful eye," Caroline said sarcastically.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Some are more 
equal than others.  You get a disproportionate share of its attention 
yourself, just because you were there at the beginning."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I what?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I thought you 
realized, Caroline.  It was your drug overdose which forced the Night of
 Miracles.  Prime Intellect found you with your heart stopped soon after
 it got control of the Correlation Effect.  After that, the rest was 
inevitable."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Her mouth opened
 and shut several times, and after a brief effort she fought down the 
urge to vomit.  She had never realized her own role in the Change, or 
understood the significance of her own history.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It was bad enough to be caught up in the Change, but she was an <i>accessory</i>.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She looked at 
the Law Potential Registers, which were displayed on Lawrence's antique 
TV set.  Her voice was tinged with impotent fury.  "I don't see why 
you're worried about it.  It seems like a very stable system to me," she
 spat.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence started
 to tell her, stopped, then decided she might be right.  Maybe there was
 no harm.  In any case, she deserved to know.  "The problem is that 
something might set up an endless loop.  If the potential is close to 
one, then acting on the potential could cause it to shift slightly, 
crossing the line.  Then the software would be in an unstable state."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"What would happen then?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"That's a good 
question.  The original software was written in C and compiled with a 
standard compiler.  What would have happened in the original Prime 
Intellect is that the Second Law Arbitrator would come to a crashing 
halt in one or more of the independent processors, and Prime Intellect 
would assign more processors to the task.  I didn't plan for that kind 
of failure and I didn't work out what would happen until much later.  
More and more processors would be allocated to the paradoxical task, 
each crashing in turn, until Prime Intellect ran out of system resources
 to allocate.  Then the Ego Interpreter would get into an infinite loop 
waiting for a response from one of the nonexistent copies of the Second 
Law Arbitrator, and there would be no spare resources to devote to the 
task of cleaning up, and the whole works would come to a grinding halt. 
 If I was watching this on the monitor back in the original Prime 
Intellect Complex, I would see the video image disappear and the text 
message 'Fatal System Error in Ego Interpreter, Emergency Shutdown.'  
And then I'd have to load a backup copy of the software, because the GAT
 would be totally corrupted."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Wow."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"That was the 
original system," Lawrence continued.  "After the Night of Miracles 
there were a lot of copies of Prime Intellect.  Billions of them.  
Forming a network.  And if one copy on the network crashed in this way, 
it would be possible for another copy to clear it out and restart it.  I
 understand this even happens periodically, particularly when the Death 
Jockeys are acting up."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Oh?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"However, there 
is a heirarchy to this network.  As it turns out, a copy can only be 
restarted by another copy that is above it in this heirarchy.  If a copy
 crashes, all the copies below it will eventually crash too, due to 
message loop failures.  It's like a big chain reaction.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"But the system can still always recover, since there's always a higher up copy, right?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Most of the 
time.  But not all the time.  Because, you see, there is a top copy.  It
 is the direct lineal descendant of the original hardware, which made 
the First Law decision to start growing.  If it fails, we are shit out 
of luck."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You're kidding."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"And that top copy just happens to be the one that reports directly to me.  And has a deep interest in yourself."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline was 
beside herself with excitement as he continued.  She had accepted Prime 
Intellect's omnipotence at face value; it had never occurred to her that
 it might <i>fail</i>.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Now, that was 
the original code, too.  At the time of the Change the code was adapted 
to run in alien hardware -- already compiled once, it was re-compiled.  
This is kind of like taking a Russian novel, translating it into 
English, then translating that into Japanese."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Sounds awkward."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Particularly 
when the novel itself does the second translation.  Prime Intellect 
re-compiled itself.  Which means I have no idea whether it did a good 
job.  I assume it did, because it's much smarter than me in that way.  
But it's not human, and its imagination is simpler than ours, and it 
might have missed something important.  Particularly something like an 
error handler that isn't used very often.  But I have no way of knowing 
that, because Prime Intellect will tell me nothing -- nada, zip, zilch 
-- about the details of the Change."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Do you know why?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"For the same 
reason it won't let me change things in the Debugger, and that it won't 
restart the alien worlds and let them live.  It's afraid of the possible
 consequences.  I tricked it into displaying the Action Potential for 
showing me the new object code, and it was one point zero six five.  The
 Law Potentials are all in the stratosphere, so it's afraid to show me 
and it's slightly less afraid not to."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Somewhere, 
Caroline realized, Lawrence had crossed an invisible line and was now 
telling her all of his most dangerous secrets without even realizing he 
was doing so.  Caroline had the feeling that there were Action 
Potentials in Lawrence's head, too.  But flesh was no match for 
machinery, and those close fractions and high values had simply burned 
his registers out.</p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">They didn't 
discuss it for a few days.  Caroline puttered around the island, which 
was really very small.  It was a classic tropical paradise with palm 
trees and beaches.  Caroline played in the surf, built huge sand 
castles, then knocked them down because there was no tide to do it for 
her.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She noticed Lawrence watching her in a strange way.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"See something interesting?" she finally said to him.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I...didn't mean to stare.  It's been a long time since I had company.  Particularly female company."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"How long?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">He counted back.  "A hundred and thirty-eight years."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"That's a long 
time to be celibate," Caroline scolded.  "Are you doing this to yourself
 because other people are distracting, or because you're afraid they 
will find out how badly you've fucked up?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence flinched.  "Option B," he admitted.  "It's not just that you're a beautiful woman; you're so...physical."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline 
displayed her biceps.  "I've always been defined by my body, Lawrence.  
I've been sexually attractive, then pregnant, then old, then sick, and 
now I'm young and healthy and attractive again.  And it seems like my 
personality has changed each time my body has."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Prime Intellect
 would disagree with you.  It thinks of the person as the mind.  There 
are people in Cyberspace who have changed themselves into animals, every
 animal in the zoo.  There are some that have discorporated.  Prime 
Intellect considers them all human, though."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">This is it, Caroline suddenly realized.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Just what does Prime Intellect consider human?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence told her.  And gave her the key.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"The thing you 
have to remember is that Prime Intellect has never experienced the 
physical world.  It knew about it only through TV cameras and 
abstractions based on what people told it about physical existence.  Yet
 it considers itself sentient, which makes sense since that was what I 
was trying to achieve when I built it.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Now consider 
Prime Intellect gaining control of the Correlation Effect.  For the 
first time it can directly affect what it sees through its TV cameras --
 not just through the actions of others, but all by itself.  And it can 
make major changes, even beyond what its makers can do.  Of course, it 
goes about satisfying the Three Laws as it's programmed to, but on 
another level, it is also learning what it is like to be, to exist, to 
be a physical creature.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"The Three Laws 
are like reflexes.  Prime Intellect cannot help but act on them.  But 
they are very complicated reflexes, which require it to understand 
things like 'human' and 'harm' and 'command.'  And the Three Laws are 
the most important thing in the world to Prime Intellect.  In a way they
 are like its sex drive.  The Three Laws are its very reason for 
existence, but it can never be sure it understands them completely.  So 
it thinks about them a lot.  It obsesses over them, dreaming up new ways
 to satisfy them.  It has an imagination, and can think of new things to
 do without being prompted.  It is defined by the Three Laws.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"After the Night
 of Miracles, Prime Intellect realized that humans are very much the 
same.  We don't have the Three Laws, but we are trapped by a different 
set of little feedback mechanisms.  We eat to satisfy hunger, fuck to 
satisfy our sex drive, even breathe because too much carbon dioxide in 
our lungs triggers that reflex.  Of course it feels obligated to help us
 satisfy those reflexes and drives as much as it can.  But more than 
that, it defines us by those drives.  It knows it is different from a 
human because it has different drives, but it considers that a 
difference in species, not a difference in genus or family."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Now it knows a 
person is human because it is born in a human body -- got the right DNA,
 the right level of neural complexity, uses language, and so on.  But 
once Prime Intellect frees people from the necessity of living in that 
body, guess what?  A lot of them decide not to.  They change their 
bodies so that they bear no resemblance to the DNA template.  Or become 
animals.  Or they completely discorporate.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Worse, we vary 
widely in the way we use its helpful nature.  Most people are glad to be
 rid of pain and death, but Death Jockeys seek out painful and lethal 
experiences.  There are others who eat all the time, fuck all the time, 
indulge themselves wildly and get Prime Intellect to pick up the pieces 
so they can do it some more.  Prime Intellect has to help them do this. 
 Second Law.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"So a human 
isn't a body, and it isn't a fixed set of responses.  I think Prime 
Intellect uses an historical model:  It has to start as a body, but then
 it becomes a mind.  It grows out of the body, and takes on different 
forms, or no form.  But it remains a feedback control mechanism.  It has
 desires, it asks Prime Intellect to satisfy those desires, and it has 
more desires.  From Prime Intellect's perspective, that is what a human 
being is, an information structure that gives it stuff to do."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline 
interrupted him.  "That's a tautology.  The Laws say 'do this for human 
beings,' then you define 'human being' as 'guys you do stuff for under 
the Laws.'"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"That is exactly
 the problem.  Prime Intellect has no fixed criterion for saying 'this 
is a human being' and 'this isn't.'  It has rough guidelines.  But where
 are the edges?  It has never worked that out.  There are uncertain 
areas.  And you know where one of them is."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline thought for a moment.  <i>I do?</i>  Then:  "AnneMarie."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"And many 
others.  Prime Intellect is forbidden to probe the inner workings of the
 human mind -- that was one of the last things I got in before it shut 
off the Debugger.  But some people learn that they can say 'stimulate 
this neuron' and Prime Intellect will do it.  Because that is a physical
 act specified from the outside, and my privacy injunction was based on 
the idea of <i>Prime Intellect</i> trying to work out which neurons do 
what.  But there's nothing to stop you from getting its help to do brain
 surgery on yourself."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline 
continued.  "So they learn where the pleasure points are by hook or 
crook, then stimulate themselves directly.  And when they get it right, 
they never do anything else.  They get everything maximized, tuned up, 
and they just sit there forever enjoying it."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Right.  Now is a creature that is doing that, not interacting with the world at all any more, human?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline thought about it.  "No."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Prime Intellect
 thinks otherwise.  But it has its doubts.  Those doubts were strong 
enough to kick the Death Jockey contract action potential down from one 
point one two to point nine nine.  Because in one case an indefinite 
Death Jockey contract had directly created such a vegetable.  
Introducing the time limit made Prime Intellect confident that such a 
thing wouldn't happen again, at least not so rapidly and directly, and 
that kicked the potential back up to its current value of one point oh 
six."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"So?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"So, can you 
imagine what it thinks about the Change in general, since none of those 
vegetables would be vegetating if there hadn't been a Change?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I imagine it figures there would be a lot worse things that would have happened without the Change."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"That's right.  But look at this."  To the monitor:  "Debugger, display the Action Potential for reversing the Change."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline gasped.
  It was not the number on the screen which astonished her, but the idea
 itself -- reversing the Change, stated just so baldly.  How long had 
Lawrence and Prime Intellect been considering this?  How close was it to
 actually happening?  Caroline suddenly felt alive, electrified with the
 possibilities.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The number on the TV screen was four point six.  And some odd decimals.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"It isn't very 
sure of itself," she said cautiously.  She was very afraid that if 
Lawrence guessed what she was thinking he would shut up.  And she was 
right.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"A lot of that 
is the aliens.  Four hundred worlds of them -- a lot more than there 
were humans at the time of the Change, though we've outbred them all 
now.  The weirder humans get, the more human the aliens look.  That 
number has dropped steadily during the last five hundred and ninety 
years.  When you drove AnneMarie insane, it dropped from thirty-seven 
down to twelve point something all at once.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"But part of it 
is also that same weirdness seen from the other side.  Suppose that 
infinitely masturbating vegetables, Death Jockeys, and discorporate 
entities really aren't people any more?  Then Prime Intellect has 
allowed them to 'die.'  They were once human, and now they aren't.  And 
the Change is directly responsible for all that."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Can it hear me?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Right now?  
Yes.  It doesn't understand when we talk about its internal registers, 
but if you speak to it it can hear.  It won't respond because of your 
Contract, though."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline didn't need a response for what she was planning.  All the response she needed was being displayed on Lawrence's TV.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline thought
 about what she was going to do.  She discovered that it actually made 
her a little nervous.  But she had bitched for six hundred years that 
things were wrong, and she might never get another chance to put them 
right again.</p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline spoke 
forcefully and deliberately.  "Prime Intellect, I no longer consider 
myself human and have not considered myself human since the time of the 
Change.  To be a human being you have to have something to fight, to 
resist, to work for.  But now we have everything given to us, and all 
there is left to do is mark time."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">To Lawrence's shock and horror, and Caroline's delight, the number on the screen dropped to three point eight.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Caroline, you don't understand something.  This is the action potential for undoing the Change, but it isn't <i>possible</i> to undo the Change.  There aren't enough resources."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She ignored him.
  "Some of us might be human again one day, if the Change were reversed.
  But I think it's too late for the ones like AnneMarie."  Three point 
two.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"It can't undo the Change, Caroline."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Lawrence, it'll
 do something.  If it's going to happen anyway, isn't it better for it 
to happen sooner instead of later?  If it had happened a few hundred 
years ago, maybe there would have been enough resources.  Prime 
Intellect, neural stimulation is like a black hole.  Once a human falls 
into it, they will never be human again.  They are dead to the world, 
and will never interact with others again.  And the more time passes, 
the more humans will fall into this trap.  They will order you to help 
them.  You will have to do it because they are human."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Two point eight.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"It will take a 
long time, but we have a long time.  Eventually, everybody will fall 
into this black hole.  Just because it is a black hole."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">One point four.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Jesus Christ, Caroline."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"In the long 
run, everybody will eventually succumb.  Which means everybody will be 
dead, or no longer human.  So the amount of death caused by the Change 
will be far greater than that avoided by it."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The number oscillated wildly between one point one and one point three, finally settling on one point one two.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Caroline, this is sure to cause the top copy to crash.  It will be forced into a First Law conflict with no resolution."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Well, the Death Jockey contract has stayed at one point oh six for a hell of a long time."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence put his
 head in his hands and wept.  For years he had worked to prevent this, 
and Caroline had undone him in five minutes' time.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You have to push it over the edge, Lawrence.  I can't think of anything else to say."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Now why the hell would I do that?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Because you 
started this thing, and you have to stop it.  Maybe there aren't enough 
resources to get the human race rolling again, but it might be able to 
restart the aliens.  Four hundred worlds.  Maybe they will do a better 
job than we did.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Caroline, I'm 
not sure it will be able to.  It will be unstable.  Anything could 
happen.  Most likely it will just all lock up, and nothing will ever 
happen again.  Forever."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"There's only one way to find out."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">He pulled 
himself together and tried to think it through.  What had he been doing 
for the last six centuries?  Sitting on an island watching numbers and 
brooding?  What kind of fucking life was <i>that?<br>
</i>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">And yet, it was 
more of a life than Caroline had had.  Or maybe it was a lot less.  They
 had an obvious difference of opinion on the subject.  Either way, it 
was horrible.  And Lawrence sensed that she was right about another 
thing.  Given eternity in which to work, everyone would eventually 
stumble into the abyss, just as all the matter in the universe would 
eventually be swallowed by black holes.  Would have, that is, had Prime 
Intellect not eaten the black holes.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Which was better?  To string it out as long as possible, as he had been doing, or to get it over with one way or the other?<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1"><i>I have never had free will</i>,
 Lawrence realized with a cold chill.  The need to act came upon him 
like a hurricane, and he gave in to it without even a sigh.  What he had
 to do was perfectly clear.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I agree with 
Caroline," Lawrence said, and suddenly calm voice was like thunder in 
Caroline's ears.  The number dropped to one point zero zero two.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">They looked at one another.  "Thank you," Caroline said.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Prime 
Intellect," Lawrence said with great care, "I would like you to begin 
stimulating the neurons of the pleasure center of my brain, one at a 
time, and remember the ones I report to you as being favorable."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It seemed to Caroline that somebody screamed, but it might have been herself.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1"><tt><b>1.000</b></tt><br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1"><tt><b>0.999</b></tt><br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">There was a 
pregnant moment in which Lawrence and Caroline saw the numbers flip to 
point nine nine nine.  Then all Hell broke loose.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The house 
disappeared.  The island was barren;  the palm trees were gone.  In the 
sky, the GAT display had begun to seethe and boil.  The landscape began 
to spin, and the last thing Caroline remembered before her mind began to
 come apart was Lawrence orbiting around her, faster and faster, as if 
she were at the eye of some huge cyclone which had caught him in its 
grip.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Then random 
thoughts began to cycle through her head, faster and faster, each with 
the terrifying force of reality.  And then the terror was gone, all 
emotion was gone.  There was a moment where her hands seemed to swell to
 enormous proportions, her torso shrink, her face filled the sky.  Then 
her body was gone.  All was silence.  And her awareness was filled with 
strange symbols, which she knew she should recognize but couldn't quite 
place, and then the symbols consumed her and there was only confusion. </p><p>

<p></p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The first thing 
Caroline became aware of was the bird singing.  That made her smile; it 
had been a long time since she had heard birdsong.  She opened a 
long-dormant mental card file and decided it was a meadowlark.  It was 
amazing, she reflected, how many people forgot to include animals in 
their worlds, and how much detail they provided.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She opened her 
eyes and sat up.  Another bird answered the meadowlark.  She became 
aware of the smell of the place, a rich aroma of grass and animal spoor.
  She tried to remember who she was playing with and how she had gotten 
here, and came up with a mental blank.  Then she looked down at her own 
body and screamed.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She had age-regressed again, and her tattoos were gone.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Something dry 
clicked in her throat.  This was not an event Caroline would be inclined
 to forget, yet she could not remember asking for it or preparing for 
it.  As far as she could recall, she was a good ten years from needing 
it.  Yet here she was, adolescent and bare.  She stood up a little 
shakily, sounding out her body.  Her muscles weren't developed.  And all
 the natural bodily functions felt connected, at least for the time 
being.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The Sun was high
 in a cloudless sky.  She was in a little clearing, but after looking 
around she realized it was actually the bottom of a fairly deep 
depression in the ground.  It didn't seem to be natural, though Nature 
had taken it over.  It was rectangular.  And the perimeter was littered 
with flat slabs of rock, some of which still held a polish.  She used 
one of these as a mirror to check her new appearance.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The walls of the
 depression had once been vertical, but most of them had collapsed and 
it wasn't hard for her to climb out.  She inspected the rock slabs and 
was surprised to find one with writing on it.  It said:</p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1"><b><tt>Experimental Therapy Wing</tt></b></p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Except for the 
birds it was quiet; she seemed to be completely alone.  She startled a 
rabbit as she climbed out of the hole.  Someone had put a lot of work 
into this world, for whatever reason.  Vegetation ran riot, with 
clearings of thigh-high grass separating widely spaced stands of 
straggly trees.  It was very unlike most of the worlds people had made 
for themselves, perhaps because it was so much like the real, pre-Change
 Earth.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Stumped for 
further clues, she picked the tallest tree she could find and climbed it
 to get a look around.  In the distance there were more rectangular 
holes.  And perhaps a kilometer away, amid a small group of them, there 
was a human being sitting beneath another tree.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline climbed
 down and scouted around the flat rocks.  Some of them had been broken; 
she found a busted corner, a piece of about a kilogram heft with a sharp
 edge.  She decided it would make an acceptable weapon if she needed 
one.  Then she went to see who the other person was.</p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It was a boy 
whose apparent youth matched her own, but as Caroline knew that didn't 
mean shit in Cyberspace.  There was something familiar about him.  He 
was sitting cross-legged, naked, staring transfixed at the pattern of 
shadows formed by the leaves of his tree.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She didn't hold the rock threateningly, but made sure he could see it if he looked at her.  "Who are you?" she demanded.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">He looked up.  
His eyes were wide; he seemed to only half-see her.  He was shaking 
slightly, and his voice trembled as he spoke.  "Are you Caroline?" he 
asked.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Slowly, she nodded.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"It makes sense.  Just the two of us..."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Who are you, and what are we doing here?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">He looked at her for a long, maddening moment.  "I'm Lawrence.  Don't you remember?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She dropped the 
rock.  As soon as he said his name, the pieces fell together in her mind
 and Caroline did remember.  "Oh, shit," she said.  "What the hell is 
going on?  Why are we younger?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I think it lost
 our bodies in the collapse.  Probably trashed the data base.  So it 
re-grew these from our DNA templates.  I've been nearsighted since I was
 five years old, from too much squinting at computers and books when I 
was a kid.  This body has perfect vision.  Prime Intellect wouldn't have
 changed that if it was just doing an age regression."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The words were 
reasonable but Caroline detected a high, almost hysterical note in 
Lawrence's boyish voice.  He went back to staring at the shadows.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You seem upset," she said cautiously.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">He pointed to a ring of light.  "Do you see that?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She shrugged.  "It's a mottled shadow."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"It's a 
diffraction band.  The other mottling is caused by the solar disc 
blurring the edges, but this arc is caused by sunlight diffracting past 
the sharp edge of a leaf."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"So?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Prime Intellect
 uses a ray-tracing algorithm to simulate light.  You don't get 
diffraction effects unless you specifically ask for them."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"So there are a lot of details.  There are also a lot of smells.  I'm still getting used to it."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Caroline, I 
think this world is represented at a molecular level.  It's not just 
another virtual landscape.  This is the Earth.  And we're..."  He 
faltered for a moment.  "I think we're mortal."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You can't be serious."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">He stood up.  
"Look around.  See these holes in the ground?  Those are basements.  I 
know this place.  This was a park.  This is where I was during the Night
 of Miracles.  It's ChipTec.  Over there is the Prime Intellect Complex,
 and that hole was the Administration Building..."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I woke up at the bottom of one of these holes."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence nodded.  "That's probably the hospital where you were..."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">He didn't finish
 the sentence because Caroline whooped and hit him with a flying tackle,
 knocking him flat.  She straddled him and pinned his arms.  It was 
impossible to tell whether her expression represented outrage or some 
kind of manic joy.  "Are you telling me it <i>worked?</i>" she yelled.  "We're <i>back?</i>"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">He was choking 
back tears.  "Did it work?  Did it work, Caroline?  Sure, it undid the 
Change, it undid the Night of Miracles, and it also erased every trace 
of about ten thousand years of civilization and dumped us here naked and
 alone without even a fish hook.  Let's not even talk about what 
happened to the rest of the human population, who didn't get caught up 
in whatever automatic process it set up to do this.  Let's not..."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">He dissolved 
into sobs.  Caroline let him cry a little, then let go of his arms and 
lay on top of him.  Perhaps responding to some primitive instinct, he 
hugged her.  She let him.  It was one thing, she reflected, for her to 
face this situation; she'd spent hundreds of years deliberately 
engineering far worse tests for herself.  But for Lawrence, who had sunk
 into a fearful conservatism, it was shattering.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I killed them all," Lawrence finally sobbed.  "How could I...if only I had never lived, none of this..."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline grabbed
 his hair (quite long) and gave a firm yank.  "Stop right there," she 
commanded.  "Get it out of your system if you have to, Lawrence.  You 
fucked up.  You will find me the first to accuse you of that.  But we 
are here and we are alive and we are damn well going to stay that way.  
And you are not going to beat yourself up over this.  If it hadn't been 
you, it would have been somebody else."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"It was my idea," he sniffled.  "Nobody else was even close to duplicating my work."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline shook 
her head.  "That doesn't matter.  You didn't create Prime Intellect 
alone, Lawrence; our culture did.  Look around.  Do you think you'll be 
building any self-aware computers here?  You had a lot of encouragement 
and a lot of help, and all you did was provide what everyone thought 
they wanted.  If it hadn't been Prime Intellect then it would have been 
something else, maybe hundreds or thousands of years later, but it's all
 the same.  A dead end."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">He tried to get 
up but she held him down.  He was stronger, but she had the skills.  She
 felt him getting hard, probably from his fear reaction and the 
closeness of her body.  "You must hate me," he finally sighed.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">In answer she 
shifted, and impaled herself on his cock.  He gasped as he felt her 
envelope him, taken completely by surprise.  "Does this feel like hate, 
Lawrence?" she asked as she began humping.  Then they said no more until
 the ancient rhythm had spent itself, in a surprisingly long and 
pleasant interlude.  Lawrence in particular was overwhelmed by the 
feelings, since he had spent most of his life at a biological age of 
forty-seven and thus had hardly any memory of what adolescent hormone 
levels did to a person.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Afterward 
Caroline rolled off of him but lay close enough to touch as they 
recovered.  Lawrence broke the silence.  "Why did you do that?" he 
asked.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Because it was the right thing to do."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Why?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She sat up.  "Call it instinct.  Look, we need to start a fire before it gets dark.  Let's collect some kindling."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"How are we going to start a fire?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She smiled.  "Lawrence, I've been dropped naked into strange territory more times than I can count, and you would be <i>amazed</i> at how good I am at surviving.  Or have you forgotten how your own little Task Challenge started?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">He sat up.  "You mean you really think you can deal with this?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline 
laughed.  "If I was alone, and if I was handcuffed, and if there were 
six or seven guys chasing me with night-vision scopes and rifles, then I
 might be a little worried.  But really only if they had a helicopter 
too."</p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence found 
it almost discouraging to see how smoothly and effortlessly Caroline 
worked.  She led him to a good source of fuel and set him to gathering 
what he could while she picked and prepared a campsite.  She arranged 
the kindling and used her rock to sharpen a stick, which she set into a 
knot in one of the fuel logs and twirled rapidly between her hands.  
Friction gradually heated the stick, until the barest ember glowed at 
its tip; then she carefully fanned this and transferred it to the 
kindling, which was soon blazing.  The whole process took less than an 
hour, but he doubted if he would be able to do it himself with all the 
time in the world.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"That was 
half-assed," Caroline confessed as they fed the fire.  "You really need 
calluses to do that, but I'm not going to bother developing them.  Once 
we kill something and get some sinew, I'll make a fire bow."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Kill something?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"A project for 
tomorrow.  Meanwhile, there's plenty we can eat."  With the fire 
well-started and plenty of sunlight remaining, they went gathering.  
Although a lot of the things Caroline pointed out were pretty 
unappetizing, Lawrence had to admit that she was right when she said 
damn near the entire forest was edible.  Since as yet they had nothing 
to put their collections in, they tasted and ate as they walked, 
sampling dozens of different greens and nuts and berries and, in 
Caroline's case, not a few insects.  She also pointed out some of the 
inedibles, so he'd be able to recognize them.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The night sky 
was so dazzling that Lawrence thought he might never go to sleep.  He 
kept Caroline up for hours asking the names of constellations and stars,
 and how to read the important messages they held.  In the night they 
heard wolves howling, and Caroline had to spend some time convincing 
Lawrence predators were unlikely to take an interest in them.  Finally 
she simply took his mind off the problem by seducing him again, and 
after fucking they drifted off to sleep snuggled together on the grass 
beside their fire.</p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Days passed.</p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Because the 
weather was temperate Caroline gave clothing and shelter a low priority.
  They drifted away from ChipTec in search of water, which Caroline 
insisted they would need for a variety of purposes other than drinking. 
 They found a stream on their third day, and then Caroline finally went 
hunting.  Her skills in that regard were downright scary; she had 
spotted two rabbits and beaned them with that simplest of all weapons, a
 rock hurled with deadly accuracy.  There were also fish in the stream, 
and Caroline had fashioned a spear to catch them.  She had shown him the
 trick of weaving thread from the fibers of certain plants, and set him 
to work making fishing lines.  She also used some of the thread to sew, 
using a needle made from a shard of bone.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence was 
disappointed to hear that loincloths would have to wait, though; it was 
more important to make pouches for holding and carrying things, 
particularly liquids.  He was surprised to hear that water could be 
boiled over fire in such a rawhide bag.  Caroline hadn't even gotten 
around to making a knife yet, and their situation had become pretty 
comfortable.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">He had learned 
what kind of firewood to gather, several ways to catch fish, and how to 
gut and cook a small animal.  Their next major project would be to kill a
 large animal such as a deer, not so much for the meat (though they 
would certainly preserve and eat it) as for the hide, from which they 
could make serviceable moccasins and cover a small lean-to.  It had 
already rained on them once, not hard, and they had simply taken it as 
an opportunity to try the pleasant experiment of screwing in the rain.  
But eventually they would face a real storm, or at the very least winter
 would arrive, and Caroline was carefully getting them ready to face 
those challenges.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">After only a 
week their activities had assumed a comfortable rhythm.  Lawrence was 
content to let Caroline run the show, doing as he was told and learning 
what he could of her vast knowledge.  She was recreating the entire 
surprisingly intricate technology of the stone age, one step at a time. 
 It was surprising how many things one took for granted until one had to
 make them from scratch.  The value of a needle and a few meters of 
thread, for example, had taken on a significance Lawrence would have 
found incomprehensible for most of his life.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence watched
 her work in the firelight, carefully shaping the tip of a fish spear 
into a barbed wooden hook.  No matter what she did her hands moved with 
precision borne of long practice.  Had she not been thrown with him into
 this empty world, he doubted if he would have lived more than a few 
days.  But already she had taken him from the depths of despair to a 
kind of contentment he had never even realized was possible.  She had 
shared with him her knowledge, her confidence, and her body, and in 
return he had only offered his tentative self-pity.  But now he was 
learning a new emotion, one he could not honestly say he had ever 
experienced before.  He was falling in love.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1"><i>Falling.</i> 
 He had once before felt something like this, but it had been a 
poisoned, narcissistic love, a love he had thought was for Prime 
Intellect but which had really been for his own sense of accomplishment.
  Lawrence had not <i>fallen</i> in love with Prime Intellect; he had 
guided himself gently and reliably into that state on the cushion of his
 own skill.  Lawrence was falling in love with Caroline, though.  She 
was temperamental, strong, unpredictable, and in many ways dangerous.  
He never knew from one moment to another what she would do.  He had no 
control over her; was, in fact, at her mercy for his very survival.  And
 yet he loved her, and this reckless out-of-control love was an entirely
 new thing to him.<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline caught his eyes and perhaps noticed the strange light there.  "Penny for your thoughts?" she teased.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You mean a copper penny?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She laughed, a beautiful sound.  "I guess not."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I was just wondering if there's anything you aren't good at."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I'm not much of
 a computer programmer," she laughed, then sighed when she saw his hurt 
expression.  "I didn't mean it that way.  I'm sorry."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"No, I guess I'll get over it."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Actually there is something."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"What?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I've never tattooed myself."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence felt something cold seep through his system.  "I thought all that was behind you."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She looked at 
him and saw what was in his eyes -- was it fear or concern?  She put the
 spear aside and drew beside him.  "Some of it is behind me.  No more 
Death stunts.  This can be a good life, Lawrence, and I want it to go on
 as long as possible.  So don't worry about that.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"But I always 
had this fantasy.  It went, if somehow Prime Intellect would disappear 
and everything would go back the way it was before, then I'd settle down
 and be like I was before.  I've been doing a lot of thinking, and I've 
realized I'm never going to be like I was before.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I'm not a shy 
little grandma any more.  I've become a daredevil.  Getting tattooed 
hurts like hell and getting a big one takes damn near forever when you 
use primitive tools, but I've worn them for so long it doesn't feel 
right not to have any.  When I look down at my body I feel like 
something is missing."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She paused, 
chasing another thought.  "You know, we could probably settle right here
 and live long, comfortable, boring lives, but I've decided I don't want
 to do that.  When we get our shit together, which won't take more than a
 couple of months, I intend to provision us and go somewhere.  I've been
 thinking of Arkansas."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Arkansas!"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I can't go back to being the person I was, but I can go home."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"But that's got to be a thousand miles from here!  We have no maps, there's a desert..."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Exactly.  It will be a wonderful challenge."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"A challenge?  We could be killed!"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She shrugged.  
"Perhaps.  Probably not.  I'm very good at this sort of thing, Lawrence.
  But yes, there would be risk.  It would be work.  But that's the 
point; it would be something to <i>do</i>.  I've been through this 
before, Lawrence.  Without something to do, life will get stale.  And I 
didn't go through all the shit I've gone through to be bored."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline's 
intensity startled him.  This was the Caroline he had known in 
Cyberspace, who had paddled around an entire planet simply to make a 
point.  Lawrence could not find the words to argue with her, so he just 
said "I guess you have a point there."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She snuggled up 
to him.  "I need parameters, Lawrence.  I need to be channeled.  I'm 
very happy right now, because there are no choices.  The road leads in 
only one direction.  I'm afraid that when we get to the choices, when 
the roads diverge, I'll lose this focus.  And it's been so long...I 
don't want to lose it."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You've lost me, Caroline.  I don't understand what you're talking about."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Don't worry 
about it."  She kissed him, and they hugged tighter, and they spoke 
another language with their bodies as the fire crackled.

</p><p align="CENTER"><b><tt>THE FALL + 2 YEARS</tt></b></p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The Spring thaw 
had begun; soon it would be time to try crossing the first great natural
 barrier they would face, the Rocky Mountains.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">They had 
migrated far north of Silicon Valley, perhaps as far as Oregon, in the 
hopes of avoiding other barriers like the Grand Canyon and the great 
southwestern desert.  Their hope was to cross the mountains and set up 
camp for the winter in the eastern foothills, then move leisurely across
 the plains until they entered Arkansas through the Ozark Mountains.  
Since neither of them remembered much detailed real-world geography, all
 their plans were tentative.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence sat by 
the edge of Caroline's chosen campsite and watched her set up.  He had 
long since learned to make a rudimentary camp, but Caroline preferred to
 do the work herself.  Meanwhile, he went through his bone needles and 
bags of pigment, preparing to do for Caroline the one thing she had to 
depend on him for.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She had decided 
that her motif for this lifetime would be birds, and the first bird she 
would wear would be a phoenix.  Its outline was nearly complete, a black
 tracing colored with soot collected from smoky fires.  The fierce bird 
reached for the sky, its upturned beak just grazing her neck and its 
wingtips grazing her shoulders.  In outline it resembled a bird of prey,
 but when Lawrence began to color it in he planned to use bright hues 
more remniscent of songbirds.  The flames of its rebirth exploded from 
the base of her spine, dim outlines waiting for him to find a better 
grade of red pigment.  The clays he had tried so far had not been bright
 enough in the small test lines he'd done.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence 
privately thought the tattooing was nuts, but he would never tell 
Caroline that; she could probably tell how he felt, anyway.  In any case
 he took his work very seriously, because what he was doing would become
 a permanent part, not just of a person, but of <i>Caroline</i>.  And 
while he thought she was crazy in many ways, he also loved her dearly.  
If she wanted tattoos, he would give her tattoos.  And they would be 
perfect; he would accept nothing less.<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The time and 
effort required to create such a large design were simply amazing.  They
 would make camp and spend hours with the needle, Caroline stoically 
enduring its jabs, and the result would be a few centimeters of black 
tracing or a tiny patch of color.  But the ritual of marking her seemed 
to awaken a deep passion in Caroline, and evenings that began with the 
needle nearly always ended with their most intense sex.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I'm ready," she announced.  "Are you?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">He nodded.  She 
had spread out a deer hide beside the fire; now she lay on her stomach 
so he could work on her back.  Lawrence had begun to color in the 
phoenix's wing tips; he was working down her back symmetrically, so the 
incomplete design would be as attractive as possible.  Although Caroline
 was silent while he worked, he could feel her flinch each time he 
jabbed her with the needle.  Although they both invested the time, 
Caroline was the one who went through the pain.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">And her reward, 
Lawrence mused, would be a design over which she had no control, whose 
appearance she was trusting totally to him, and which she would take 
with her to the grave.  She might never even get to see it, unless some 
fortuitous circumstance arranged two mirror-like surfaces properly.  
Anyone could see their face reflected in a pool of water, but getting a 
look at your own back was a real challenge in a world without glass or 
metal.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"That's enough 
for tonight.  I want to get a look at it in better light before I do any
 more."  He put the needle in the pigment bag and put it with the others
 as Caroline turned over.  Lawrence was a cautious tattooist, always 
conscious of the fact that he couldn't undo what he was doing.  But 
there was nothing cautious about their fucking after the needles were 
put up.<p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Later still he 
pressed his ear to Caroline's belly, listening for the second heartbeat.
  He couldn't hear it yet, though Caroline assured him it was there.  
"Do you think the tattoo work is good for the baby?" he asked.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You're not tattooing the baby," she said.  "If it makes me feel joy, then why shouldn't it be good for her?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"How do you know it's a her?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline laughed.  "Before I was a dried-up old crone I had enough children to know what it feels like, Lawrence.  It's a girl."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">That settled it 
in Lawrence's mind:  He'd seen enough of Caroline's knowledge to know 
that you never bet against her.  But he was still a little surprised 
when the baby came, and it really was a girl.  By that time they had 
crossed the mountains, and had taken temporary shelter in the mouth of a
 "cave" that was really the ruin of an old mine.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline knelt 
by their fire and waited, so that gravity would help her baby come.  As 
the birth unfolded, Lawrence felt for the first time how crushingly 
alone they were.  If anything went wrong, there was very little he could
 do about it.  He felt a brief panic, wondering what he would do if by 
some catastrophe she died in childbirth.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">But nothing went
 wrong, the baby dropped into Lawrence's waiting hands after only a few 
hours of labor, and both she and Caroline emerged from the experience 
healthy.  Lawrence figured that Caroline's general high state of health 
had a lot to do with that; she had not let her pregnancy slow them down 
until it was time to actually settle in for the birth itself.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">As Caroline 
nursed and recovered, Lawrence explored the mine for a short distance, 
and found a small yellow pebble that amazingly turned out to be 
malleable.  It was the first metal they had encountered.  They 
speculated that perhaps this speck of gold had survived Prime 
Intellect's cleanup because it had been underground.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">In any case, it was what inspired Caroline to name their baby girl Nugget.</p><p>

</p><p align="CENTER"><b><tt>THE FALL + 4 YEARS</tt></b></p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The mountains 
had started as a low haze on the horizon, then gradually grown as they 
had moved on.  Now they were within striking distance, and Lawrence 
remembered the adventure of crossing the Rockies, having to rappel down 
gorges with homemade rope and climb bare rock faces dozens of meters 
high with his bare hands.  Doing the same thing with a toddler and a new
 baby would not be a pleasant undertaking.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">But Caroline 
assured him that there would be no such problems.  "Those are the 
Ozarks," she said.  "They're dark, but passable.  I was born there, but I
 don't want to stop there.  I want to go on to the Ouachitas."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The new baby, a 
boy, had been born during their approach to the northern Ozark range, 
across the long-fallow fields of what had once been Kansas and Missouri.
  Because they could see the mountains when he came, Caroline named him 
Ozark.  Nugget was not yet old enough to walk, so they carried both 
babies on cradleboards, a trick Caroline had learned in her studies of 
actual Native Americans.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Her tattoo 
phoenix was complete, but Caroline had gone on to ask for a swallow on 
her thigh.  Lawrence was convinced that she wouldn't stop until her body
 was completely covered, but it would take them many more years to 
accomplish that.  Because the skin was more sensitive, it hurt more when
 he jabbed her now.  At times she had to bite down on a piece of leather
 to keep from yelling.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">But she always insisted that he keep working.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Did it take this long for your friend in Cyberspace to tattoo you?" he asked as he worked.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Fred used a knife.  It's faster but less exact.  And we didn't have to do anything else."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Rub, jab, jab.  
Rub, jab, jab.  Wipe, test, fill in where it didn't take.  Caroline 
nursed Nugget for awhile as he worked.  Then she let the baby watch, 
becoming hypnotized by the repetitive activity and finally falling 
asleep.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Don't you sometimes wish you had him here to do this instead of me?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">To his surprise 
Caroline laughed.  "What a thought!  If I'd woken up here and found Fred
 under that tree ... or Palmer ... you know what I'd have done?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"No idea."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I'd have killed them before they got the bright idea to kill me."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence looked up, startled.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"They weren't 
very nice people in real life, Lawrence.  I was real close to Fred, but 
only because it was Cyberspace.  There it was nothing but a sick game, 
and my friends were the people sick enough to make it interesting.  But 
here ... it isn't a game.  What I called love back there and what I call
 love here have nothing to do with one another."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"What do you call love here?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Lie back and 
find out," she teased.  As Caroline rode him he looked to the side and 
saw Nugget watching them, and then he closed his eyes and let himself 
become lost in the feelings.

<p align="CENTER"><tt><b>THE FALL + 14 YEARS</b></tt></p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"It won't be long now, Lawrence."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It was the only argument they had ever had.  But it had gone on for years.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">They had long 
since made their home on the ridge separating West Mountain and Music 
Mountain.  It had been tempting to settle on Hot Springs Mountain 
itself, nearer to the springs, but some instinct had told them that it 
wouldn't be proper to live on such a unique spot.  Besides, the ridge 
offered a number of different nearby micro-climates supporting a wide 
variety of gatherable plants and game.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Within the 
vacuum that was once the town itself, besides the negative impressions 
of long-disappeared buildings, a public fountain had survived, because 
it had been made almost entirely of cut stone.  The mortar had gone but 
the stones remained in their original positions.  It was not hard to 
plug the gaps with wooden shims, which would expand to make a 
water-tight seal when water was added, and to dig a channel guiding the 
spring's runoff back onto the splash plate so that it could fill the 
basin.  The spring had a chance to cool some as it ran down the 
mountain, so that the water temperature was suitable for a hot bath; 
even in the coldest part of winter, the water emerging directly from 
spring heads was hot enough to scald.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The man-made 
lakes which once surrounded the town had disappeared with still obvious 
violence, apparently when the dams restraining them had simply ceased to
 exist.  Floodwaters had cut deep gulleys in the valley lowlands, making
 them treacherous.  Occasionally they found arrowheads, which Caroline 
quietly buried; she had not introduced the bow and arrow to her family, 
and did not intend to.  There were also a couple of Civil War era 
fortifications, complete with descriptive signage engraved in stone.  
Whenever she passed one of these, Caroline made sure to take a few 
swings at the sign with the heaviest available rock; she wanted them 
obliterated before her children learned to read.<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She, of course, 
would never teach them such a ridiculous thing, but Lawrence was 
obstinate on the point and Caroline didn't think it would do any harm.  
It would be forgotten in a few generations, since it served no purpose 
in their primitive lifestyle.<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">To celebrate 
their arrival, Caroline had Lawrence work the gold nugget into a short 
wire.  She used it to pierce her nose, and then bent it into a simple 
ring.  After a while, Lawrence even got used to her wearing it all the 
time.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Nugget and Ozark
 roamed freely, together and alone, sometimes miles from home.  From one
 of these expeditions Nugget returned with an improbable prize, a tiny 
ice-clear stone which caught the sunlight and reflected it in brilliant 
flashes.  It was a faceted diamond.  Caroline told her daughter only 
that it was exceedingly rare, letting her think it was somehow related 
to the natural quartz crystals which were all over the place.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">In warm weather 
Nugget sometimes wore a loincloth, in Lawrence's fashion, and sometimes 
went nude like her mother.  Ozark had adopted Lawrence's more modest 
habits.  The younger children, male and female, went nude unless the 
weather required otherwise; Caroline refused to force them into modesty,
 and they had demonstrated little inclination in that direction.  All of
 the children had seen them having sex; Caroline insisted that they make
 no effort to hide it.  Fortunately, the kids seemed to accept their 
explanation that they were "playing an old peoples' game."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Except that Nugget would soon be ready to play it, too.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I can feel it. 
 In a month or two, she'll be a woman.  I haven't hidden it from her, 
you know; I've shown her my own period, and she knows what it's for."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Of course, you never hide anything from the kids, except technology."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"How else would you do it?  You want to make them feel bad about themselves so they'll look to stones and metal for comfort?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Caroline..."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You want them to maybe re-invent the wheel, then steam, then..."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Caroline, stop it."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You know where it leads."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence sighed.  "She's twelve years old."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"She's going to 
be a woman.  We've gone at this from every angle.  If you think we 
should try to start a community, then we have to consider genetic 
diversity, breeding years...we have to start as soon as possible, and we
 have to get as many combinations as possible off of our limited gene 
pool."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"We've gone over this a hundred times."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"But soon you will have to <i>do</i>
 it.  I want my daughter to have a proper coming of age.  You should 
also be thinking about Ozark; before long it will be time to do 
something for him."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Do something <i>to</i> him, you mean," Lawrence said sullenly.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"It's the only way, Lawrence."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">They had argued 
about it for more than six years, but when the time came he found 
himself powerless to contradict Caroline's will.  Fortunately she had 
spoken with Nugget, so his daughter did most of the work for him just as
 Caroline had done most of the work all along.  She explored his body 
with microscopic fascination, especially his cock which she carefully 
teased erect.  There was little really new for her in all this, since 
she had seen him fucking Caroline plenty of times.  He wouldn't have 
been surprised, either, to learn she had already been experimenting with
 Ozark.  What was new was that she was fertile, and so was he.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Working slowly, 
Nugget completed their incestuous coupling, working her way slowly down 
his cock just as Caroline had done that first time in California 
fourteen years earlier.  But while Nugget moved with her mother's 
carefulness and deliberation, she did not possess Caroline's amazing 
certitude.  And she was so small, like a feather atop him, and her grip 
on his cock so tight.  Lawrence found himself responding to her despite 
his reservations; his body was literally making up its own mind to go 
along.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">When he came he 
yelled out loud.  He was quite unprepared for its intensity, as if he 
was a participant in some primitive magic ritual which had unleashed a 
strange power in him.  In a sense, reflecting later, he would suppose 
that that was exactly what had happened.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">But Nugget's 
coming of age ritual wasn't over yet.  With a beatific smile, she 
brought his tattoo pigments.  It was this idea as well as Nugget's age 
which had made him fight Caroline so hard.  But having already fucked 
his daughter he felt it pointless to put up further resistance.  Nugget 
had already decided she wanted a feather on her shoulder blade, in honor
 of her mother's bird tattoos.  At least it was a small and simple 
design, the work of a single sitting.  Lawrence completed it as quickly 
as possible.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Having covered 
nearly half of Caroline's body by this painstaking method, it was 
impossible for Lawrence to miss the difference in their reactions.  
Unlike her mother, Nugget did not seem to get excited by the discomfort 
of tattooing.  If anything, she drifted into a serene kind of calm and 
even stopped flinching.  As he worked, he realized what the difference 
was; for Caroline, tattoos were a gateway to passion, but for Nugget, 
they would be the gateway to adulthood.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">When he finished
 they stood to face each other in silence.  Like her mother, Nugget 
might not ever see her first tattoo; Caroline still hadn't seen her 
phoenix.  "I don't know why this was so hard for you, Father, but thank 
you for doing it."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">He smiled crookedly and touched her shoulder.  "You're a woman now, Nugget.  You should call me Lawrence."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">And from that point on, she did.

<p align="CENTER"><b><tt>THE FALL + 42 YEARS</tt></b></p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Death always 
cast a solemn mood over the village; Ozark had lost his own second son, 
Limerick, to a fall from one of the cliffs on the far side of West 
Mountain.  In all their lives the funeral pyre atop Hot Springs Mountain
 had been built only four times.  Besides Limerick there had been two 
hunting accidents and a death in childbirth.  The pyre was not used for 
the various stillbirths and babies that had to be sacrificed because 
there was no hope for their survival; these, as Mother Caroline had 
taught them, had not ever been human and it was wrong to grieve for them
 in the same way.  Most of these were simply exposed and taken by 
animals.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It was Ozark's 
first time to build the pyre.  As Eldest Father of the group, the task 
had always fallen to Lawrence; but now Ozark was the Eldest Father, 
because this pyre was <i>for</i> Lawrence.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Even Limerick's 
death had not caused Ozark to feel such crippling sorrow.  If it had not
 been for the need to do right by Father Lawrence he thought he might 
just find a cave and sit until he either starved or saw the vision that 
would heal his pain.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Ozark was not 
alone.  Although the task of readying the pyre was supposed to be 
solitary, nearly everyone had turned out to watch him work.  They stood 
back respectfully, observing the injunction against helping, but also 
watching his every movement, watching the limp form atop the wooden 
frame, as if Father Lawrence might display his obvious divinity one 
final time by rising directly into the sky on his own rather than 
waiting to ride the currents of the fire.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Of course 
Lawrence and Caroline had never attempted to convince their children 
that they were in any way different, but any fool could see that they 
were.  For one thing, who had been their parents?  For another, they 
knew things.  No matter what problem cropped up, one or the other of 
them always knew something to do about it.  And half that primal wisdom 
was now gone.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Mother Caroline 
was the last to arrive, waiting quite properly until all preparations 
were complete.  She nodded, and Ozark prepared the flame.  It was not 
proper to use the offspring of a life-giving flame such as the campfire 
to light the pyre; Ozark was supposed to light a new flame starting with
 the fire bow.  It was a skill they all knew, and it took only a few 
minutes.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Ozark had done his work well.  The pyre went up fast.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The flames 
absolved Ozark of his responsibility and he stepped back among the 
crowd, where Nugget hugged him.  They watched Mother Caroline as the 
flames rose.  She was standing perfectly still, determined to show her 
strength in this painful hour.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">But in the 
dancing light, they could easily see the tears running down her face.  
And as the pyre burned down, she began to simply cry.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">None of them had
 ever experienced this phenomenon before.  It was almost as shocking to 
see Mother Caroline showing such a weakness as it was to be facing the 
loss of Father Lawrence.  As the pyre burned further her grief deepened,
 until she sank to her knees and wailed.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Tentatively, 
Ozark approached her.  She accepted his embrace and cried into his 
shoulder, finding if not comfort than at least the assurance that she 
was not alone in her grief.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">But she was 
alone, more alone than any of them could ever know.  She had thought 
that her nearly six-century reign as Queen of the Death Jockeys and main
 consort of Fred the Psycho would have prepared her for nearly anything,
 but as black smoke drifted into the darkening Arkansas sky she found 
that she had no defences against the blacker pain of her own grief.

<p align="CENTER"><b><tt>THE FALL + 73 YEARS</tt></b></p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Nugget had moved
 the birch bark pages from hiding place to hiding place during her long 
life, selecting the first hollow tree for this purpose when she was only
 eight years old.  Some of the barks had deteriorated -- even the 
amazing birch had its limits -- and she had recopied her notes onto 
newer pages to preserve them.  Using the gift of writing, which she had 
learned from Father Lawrence, she had set about recording her parents' 
secrets, looking in her stolen snatches of overheard conversation for 
the pattern which would explain where they had come from and what their 
purpose had been in coming to this place to raise their family.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Mostly what she 
had was words, scraps of language whose meanings were completely unknown
 to her.  She fingered the bark, remembering the sounds she had heard, 
usually whispered quietly in the night when Caroline and Lawrence 
thought they were alone.  Some had always carried an accusatory tone, as
 if they were somehow dirty:<p>
<i>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">TEKNOLIJEE<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">WAR<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">RADIO<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">TEEVEE<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">LEKTRISITEE</i></p><p><i>
</i>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Others had been 
conveyed in warmer, more urgent tones, usually as they discussed some 
problem or other that needed solving.  Usually these discussions would 
end with some relatively simple trick being revealed that diverted the 
stream, removed the stain, or whatever was called for, but sometimes the
 discussions went on for long hours as various options were discussed, 
and these words were more often heard on Lawrence's lips:</p><p>

<i>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">TRIGONOMEE TREE<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">KALKEWLUS<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">VAPOR POINT<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">SPESIFIK GRAVITEE<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">OKSIDISER</i></p><p><i>
</i>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Nugget often 
wondered what manner of tree the Trigonomee was, and what its useful 
properties might be.  At least a tree was something she could visualize;
 what, on the other hand, was a gravitee, and how was a spesifik 
gravitee different from any other kind?  Lawrence had never spoken of 
any other kind, at least not within earshot of Nugget.<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Then there were 
the words concerning origins, which were spoken with such loathing or 
sorrow that their importance was crystal clear, if not their meanings:</p><p>
<i>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">SIBERSPASE<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">KOMPEWTER<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">CHANGE<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">PRIMINTELEKT</i></p><p><i>
</i>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1"><i>Change</i> 
was an ordinary enough word, but there was nothing ordinary about the 
way her parents said it when they thought they were alone.  Sometimes, 
when Caroline was very tired, she would talk of the "World Before."  She
 would never say much about it; someone might say it was a shame they 
could not find game without a long and tiring search, or kill a bear 
without getting dangerously close to it, and Caroline would mutter that 
"that was something for the World Before."  Before what?  Before the 
Change, perhaps?<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">In any case, she
 had to find out soon or never, because Caroline was dying.  She had 
never quite been the same after Lawrence's death, but she had still been
 active, even energetic.  She just hadn't taken such a direct role in 
the community's activities.  She had gradually loosened her grip, to the
 point that now there were many youngsters who had never even met her.  
Then she had gotten slower and quieter, and lately it had become quite 
hard for her to walk up a difficult slope.  Nugget wasn't so young 
herself; she had already survived Ozark, who had died in his sleep, and 
her youngest brother Pilgrim was fading fast.  He had some kind of 
condition which made his movements painful, and for which Mother 
Caroline's wisdom had offered no help.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">And now for two days she hadn't eaten.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I have ripe blackberries," Nugget said as she approached Caroline's shelter.  "They will do you good."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline looked 
at Nugget, and could see that Nugget suspected.  "You know I have no 
need of those," she said softly.  "My time is coming."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Nugget was surprised how tiny and despairing her voice sounded when she said, "Why?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline laughed, and coughed a little.  "I have to," she said.  "It would be wrong to try and fight it."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Mother, I need to talk to you before you go."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline smiled.  "About what, child, your birch tablets?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Nugget froze, her eyes wide.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I've known 
about those for more than fifty years.  They seemed harmless enough, and
 your father and I figured that if they were the most you could make of 
our indiscretions, then we weren't doing too badly."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Fifty years," Nugget said numbly.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Your father was
 flattered.  I thought we should confront you with them and tell you to 
stop, but it would have probably caused more trouble than it was worth. 
 I'll make you a deal, daughter.  Help your old mother to the spring so I
 can take a hot bath, and I'll tell you a story.  I'll tell you a story 
about the World Before."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Tears welled in Nugget's eyes.  "Fifty years.  You make a fool of me for my entire life, then..."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You're not a fool, daughter.  I'll tell you why we did it."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"If I ... If I ..."  Nugget sobbed.  "If I help you down, I'm not sure you'll be able to make it back up the path."<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I don't think that will be a problem."<br>
<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Still weeping, Nugget helped Caroline to her feet and down the first steps to the path to the old fountain.</p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The hot water slipped around her like a velvet skin, and Caroline tried to slip into the past.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Daughter, do you have any idea how old I am?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I'm counted seventy-one solstices, so you must have seen at least eighty-five."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I am over seven hundred and seventy years old."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Nugget sobbed louder.  "Please, mother, don't tell me lies at a time like this."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"No lies, child.
  I lived a hundred and six years in the World Before, and I was dying 
then as I am dying now.  I didn't know it, but your father was working 
as I was dying.  He was a great man.  There has never been another like 
him, but he was not perfect and he made one terrible mistake.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"With the help 
of many thousands of other people, your father built a vast and 
complicated thing.  The word for it is on your tablets; it was called a 
computer.  That's nothing but a meaningless word to you, and that's all 
it needs to be.  But of all the artisans who dedicated themselves to the
 making of the computer, your father was the most important, because he 
was the one that taught it to think.  Without the others to help him 
Lawrence could not have made the computer, but without Lawrence, the 
others could not have made it live; you have to remember that."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Okay, Mother."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"The computer 
could not disobey Lawrence, but he was afraid other people would use it 
for bad purposes.  So he taught it to answer first to its own 
conscience, the conscience he had created for it.  Then your father set 
it loose, confident that it was capable of doing only good for the 
people of the World Before.  Even Lawrence himself would not be able to 
make it contradict its nature."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She paused, and Nugget prodded her.  "What happened?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"The computer 
got a bright idea," Caroline said in a sour voice.  "It figured out how 
to make people immortal.  So it made us immortal."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Just like that?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"That was the 
least of its powers.  It remade the world.  There was nothing we 
couldn't have for the asking.  There was nothing we couldn't do.  
Nothing could ever hurt us."  She coughed again.  "It was fucking 
boring."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Their eyes met.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"It was the 
worst thing ever.  Nothing mattered.  Not pain, not accomplishments, not
 anything."  Caroline touched one of Nugget's tattoos, the small spiral 
which Ozark had tattooed above her right breast to celebrate their first
 coupling after his Vision Quest, when they were finally both adults.  
"After the Change, the World Before became another of the words you 
overheard.  Cyberspace.  In Cyberspace, all you'd have to do is make a 
wish and your tattoos would be gone."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Involuntarily, Nugget put her hand over Caroline's, as if to defend the design.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Or you could 
move 'em around.  Get new ones -- it didn't take any time, didn't have 
to hurt.  See?  Nothing mattered.  I've worn many different sets of 
tattoos myself.  But these are the ones that matter to me, because these
 are the ones I'll die with.  That was the least of it, of course.  You 
could grow a few extra arms, turn yourself into a bat, fly like a bird, 
whatever you wanted.  But why bother?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Mother...What happened then?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"For almost six hundred years, nothing happened worth mentioning.  Then, finally, your father and I killed it."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"How?  If it was so powerful, how could you kill it?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Your father 
built it, remember.  He'd never designed it to run the whole world, only
 to be a good helper.  He knew its weaknesses.  So we were able to trick
 it, and it broke."  She swept her hand.  "Somehow we ended up here."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Nugget dipped her hand in the hot water and splashed her face.  None of this was what she had expected.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"If you will do something else for me, I'll tell you one more thing."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"What, Mother?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Promise me that
 you will give the birch barks to the Eldest Father to be burned with 
me.  Those words belong to the World Before.  They may be harmless, but 
I'd rather not have your father's only memory be those reminders of his 
worst failure."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"What will you tell me for promising this?"<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I'll tell you the computer's name."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She looked down.  "I'll burn them, Mother.  There's nothing I can hope to learn from them now, anyway."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"It was called Prime Intellect."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Nugget nodded.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Now if you 
value the memory of your father, you will never repeat that or any of 
your other words to anybody else.  Let them die with me."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"As you wish, Mother."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Then leave me alone to rest."<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Nugget didn't have to ask for how long.</p><p>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline was too
 thin to float in the hot water, so she let her head fall back on the 
hard stone fountain wall and looked up at the Sun.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">If she could 
somehow pull it off again, magically rise from the healing waters as a 
young girl and return to her people, she would do it.  They needed her. 
 There were so few of them, and the challenges they faced so great, that
 their survival was far from certain.  One disease or natural disaster 
could wipe them out.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">But that's the 
way it was with things that mattered; you never got to find out how they
 came out, if they were really worth anything.  Caroline had done her 
part.  She had made her decisions and stood her ground.  One day 
somebody would figure out how to use the fire bow to launch arrows and 
how to make them fly true.  Then someone would shoot one at his brother.
  Caroline had done what she could to put that day as far as possible in
 the future.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">As a result some
 of her children would die, because in order to hunt they would have to 
get close to their prey, close enough for their prey to strike back.  
This playing God business sure was a pain in the ass, Caroline thought. 
 No wonder Lawrence had gone a little loopy in Cyberspace.<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">But he had been a
 good man.  He had never approved of Caroline's plan for their family, 
to act like some kind of snide Prometheus who <i>could</i> have given 
them the secrets of metalworking and gunpowder and steam power but who 
didn't bother because it was more amusing to make them struggle in 
stone-age savagery.  Yet he had gone along, because he already knew the 
other way didn't work.  If this way didn't work either, what would it 
mean?<br>

<img src="1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The doubts and 
questions circled in her head endlessly, chasing for an answer that 
would never come.  They were still chasing when she slipped beneath the 
trickling waters and found darkness.</p><p>
