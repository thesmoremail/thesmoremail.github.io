1
00:00:34,463 --> 00:00:37,343
[propeller thumping]

2
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:25,710
[door slams]

3
00:01:25,963 --> 00:01:29,553
[woman] Wes, you're a beaut.
She's purring like a kitten in there.

4
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:31,260
Gonna run those tests again.

5
00:01:42,046 --> 00:01:45,166
[Wes] Link's strong.
None of those glitches we had last time.

6
00:01:45,255 --> 00:01:47,731
[woman] That last wetware update
seems to have cleared that up.

7
00:01:47,755 --> 00:01:50,705
Yeah, maybe. But I really think
we should... Oh! [chuckles]

8
00:01:51,338 --> 00:01:53,298
- Hello?
- [woman] Yeah?

9
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:54,590
[Ivrina] There a problem?

10
00:01:55,213 --> 00:01:58,133
- [woman] Can we help you?
- [man] My apologies.

11
00:01:58,588 --> 00:02:02,258
Our little evenings
have become quite popular.

12
00:02:03,713 --> 00:02:05,963
Arthur, their appearance fee.

13
00:02:08,421 --> 00:02:09,671
[Wes] Oh, thank you.

14
00:02:12,838 --> 00:02:14,418
Might I have a peek?

15
00:02:15,005 --> 00:02:17,295
I've heard so much.

16
00:02:18,588 --> 00:02:22,418
Yes. He's magnificent!

17
00:02:22,505 --> 00:02:25,045
Yes. She is.

18
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:26,170
[man] Oh.

19
00:02:27,546 --> 00:02:30,456
Of course, my apologies, "she".

20
00:02:31,046 --> 00:02:35,586
What would you say if I asked you
to lose tonight's match?

21
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:38,880
Fuck off.

22
00:02:39,546 --> 00:02:42,336
There's no need to get angry, my dear.

23
00:02:43,088 --> 00:02:45,458
- It's just business.
- [woman 1] Not to me.

24
00:02:45,796 --> 00:02:47,296
[woman 1] I don't dive...

25
00:02:47,963 --> 00:02:49,173
and I don't lose.

26
00:02:49,463 --> 00:02:51,383
And what makes you so special?

27
00:02:53,296 --> 00:02:54,416
I'm not special.

28
00:02:55,005 --> 00:02:56,005
Unique.

29
00:02:56,588 --> 00:02:59,588
No other team uses a female pilot
for their beastie.

30
00:02:59,671 --> 00:03:01,801
[coughing] That's it, then?

31
00:03:02,546 --> 00:03:03,836
Your edge.

32
00:03:04,505 --> 00:03:06,625
Women fight better than men.

33
00:03:07,046 --> 00:03:09,086
- This one does.
- [woman 2] Yeah.

34
00:03:09,171 --> 00:03:10,011
That's my girl.

35
00:03:10,088 --> 00:03:13,758
- Seventeen straight wins to prove it.
- You'll be handsomely paid, of course.

36
00:03:13,838 --> 00:03:15,298
You don't fucking listen, do you?

37
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:17,606
It may be about money for you,
but for us, it's personal.

38
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,590
Five hundred thousand.

39
00:03:22,421 --> 00:03:23,421
No.

40
00:03:25,046 --> 00:03:27,506
- One insignificant loss for more money...
- Insignificant?

41
00:03:27,588 --> 00:03:28,758
...than you could ever win?

42
00:03:28,838 --> 00:03:30,668
[exhales angrily] Fucking men.

43
00:03:30,755 --> 00:03:33,795
It's cunts like you that
fucked her up to begin with.

44
00:03:37,005 --> 00:03:38,505
[sighs] Fuck.

45
00:03:40,463 --> 00:03:41,463
A year ago,

46
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,210
<i>Sonnie got snatched by an estate gang</i>

47
00:03:44,296 --> 00:03:46,126
<i>and when they was done using her,</i>

48
00:03:46,213 --> 00:03:47,423
<i>they started cutting,</i>

49
00:03:47,505 --> 00:03:50,064
<i>- slicing their marks into her flesh.</i>
- [man laughing in the distance]

50
00:03:50,088 --> 00:03:52,298
<i>Can you imagine that kind of pain,</i>

51
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:54,170
<i>- that kind of humiliation</i>
- [woman shrieks]

52
00:03:54,296 --> 00:03:56,166
<i>carved into her skin?</i>

53
00:03:56,255 --> 00:03:58,375
<i>A lifelong reminder of that day.</i>

54
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:03,505
<i>So when Sonnie steps into the pit,
she's not fighting for pride or status</i>

55
00:04:03,588 --> 00:04:06,798
<i>and certainly not for your fucking money.</i>

56
00:04:07,755 --> 00:04:11,335
She's carving up the men
who did this to her.

57
00:04:13,296 --> 00:04:14,706
Very well, then.

58
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:16,835
I won't press you further.

59
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:19,670
Piece of shit.

60
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:27,340
Though I hope you'll reconsider.

61
00:04:30,963 --> 00:04:33,343
[distant hubbub]

62
00:04:33,421 --> 00:04:37,211
[rhythmic stomping]

00:04:58,463 --> 00:05:00,463
[audience cheering loudly]

64
00:05:08,963 --> 00:05:11,343
- [man roaring]
- [audience cheering]

65
00:05:16,171 --> 00:05:17,921
What a sweet little girl.

66
00:05:18,713 --> 00:05:20,263
You're going down...

67
00:05:21,046 --> 00:05:22,046
down...

68
00:05:22,296 --> 00:05:26,756
down... [roars]

69
00:05:27,005 --> 00:05:28,005
You okay in there?

70
00:05:28,088 --> 00:05:29,798
[opponent roars]

[cheering]

72
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:39,880
Tonight is the big night

73
00:05:40,505 --> 00:05:43,295
of the big fight!

74
00:05:43,921 --> 00:05:48,671
Brutal beasties in a bout to the death!

75
00:05:50,046 --> 00:05:51,126
Gore...

76
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:54,670
- [shouting] gore galore!
- [cheering]

77

Affinity link is booted, Sonnie.

78
00:05:56,546 --> 00:05:58,046
You ready to get in there?

79
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:13,510
[announcer] <i>Comin' in</i>
<i>on a hot winning streak...</i>

She's up and running.

81
00:06:17,338 --> 00:06:20,298
- I give you...
- And on the move.

00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:38,336
[announcer] Can you hear that?

88
00:06:40,005 --> 00:06:44,795
What's coming down...

89
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:49,050
- Yeah!
- ...to tear up the town?

90
00:06:49,505 --> 00:06:53,795
[shouting] It's Turboraptor!

Yes!

[man] Sonnie!

123
00:10:08,713 --> 00:10:10,553
Sonnie, you're a beauty!

124
00:10:11,546 --> 00:10:12,546
Fuck.

125
00:10:12,963 --> 00:10:15,513

- [man] Oh, no!
- [woman] Steady on there, little man.

131
00:10:31,588 --> 00:10:33,458
[Wes] Think they got
someone to clean that up?

132
00:10:33,546 --> 00:10:35,206
[Ivrina] I don't think
anyone cares, mate.

133
00:10:35,296 --> 00:10:38,296
Well, I might give it five minutes
and if they don't, I will.

134
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:40,960
- [Ivrina] It's a shit-hole.
- [Wes] That arm. What was that?

135
00:10:41,088 --> 00:10:42,708
[Ivrina] <i>Cheating, that's what it was.</i>

136
00:10:42,796 --> 00:10:45,397
[Wes]<i> But it was made of bone.</i>
<i>That's not against the rules, is it?</i>

137
00:10:45,421 --> 00:10:48,606
[Ivrina] <i>Yeah, I just wanna know how they</i>
<i>engineered that solid piece, that's all.</i>

138
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:50,760
You thought we were gonna
lose tonight, didn't you?

139
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:03,130
Can I help you?
[gasps]

140
00:11:05,213 --> 00:11:07,263
This place is...

141
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:09,130
amazing.

142
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:13,301
You were amazing.

143
00:11:13,713 --> 00:11:14,713
Thanks.

144
00:11:15,421 --> 00:11:17,961
Look, why are you with...

145
00:11:18,046 --> 00:11:19,046
Dicko?

146
00:11:20,546 --> 00:11:21,956
Security.

147
00:11:23,046 --> 00:11:24,046
Right.

148
00:11:25,296 --> 00:11:26,666
Ever thought of leaving him?

149
00:11:27,171 --> 00:11:28,171
Sometimes.

150
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:30,760
All the time.

151
00:11:32,088 --> 00:11:33,628
You could come with us.

152
00:11:35,338 --> 00:11:38,418
No. [laughs]
No, I couldn't.

153
00:11:40,046 --> 00:11:41,046
I envy you.

154
00:11:41,963 --> 00:11:43,343
Your bravery.

155
00:11:44,213 --> 00:11:47,093
I'm maybe even
a little bit frightened of you...

156
00:11:49,713 --> 00:11:51,553
but I'll never be like you.

157
00:12:00,463 --> 00:12:02,053
[gasps] Oh!

158
00:12:06,463 --> 00:12:09,093
How do you do it, all this...

159
00:12:09,671 --> 00:12:11,921
fighting and hatred?

160
00:12:12,005 --> 00:12:14,165
- Aren't you scared?
- Scared?

161
00:12:16,171 --> 00:12:17,511
All the time.

162
00:12:18,588 --> 00:12:19,838
Now, hate...

163
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:22,840
that was something I had to learn.

164
00:12:23,921 --> 00:12:26,721
You don't come into this world with hate,
- [woman panting] - but fear,

165
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:30,710
- that's primal.
- [woman sighs]

166
00:12:31,713 --> 00:12:33,593
- It fills your senses.
- [woman sighs]

167
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:37,550
You can see it, hear it...

168
00:12:41,088 --> 00:12:42,208
taste it...

169
00:12:44,588 --> 00:12:46,798
and it keeps me alive.

170
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:54,760
But that night, the gang, the...

171
00:12:56,838 --> 00:12:57,878
Rape.
Yeah.

172
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,380
It's not that.

173
00:13:04,546 --> 00:13:05,586
They can't see past it.

174
00:13:07,713 --> 00:13:08,923
No one can.

175
00:13:10,796 --> 00:13:12,756
But it ain't what gives me my edge.

176
00:13:13,796 --> 00:13:16,416
Angry little girl, out for revenge.

177
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:18,553
Dicko believes that shit...

178
00:13:20,213 --> 00:13:21,803
'cause he wants to.

179
00:13:23,671 --> 00:13:24,841
They all do.

180
00:13:31,421 --> 00:13:33,841
Everyone sees what they want to see.

181
00:13:37,963 --> 00:13:39,303
[sighs]

182
00:13:51,421 --> 00:13:52,421
[sighs]

183
00:14:00,463 --> 00:14:02,963
- [gurgling]
- [cane tapping]

184
00:14:03,046 --> 00:14:04,916
[Dicko] Are you scared now?

185
00:14:09,421 --> 00:14:10,591
[groans and gurgles]

186
00:14:11,005 --> 00:14:12,085
[pained grunt]

187
00:14:12,171 --> 00:14:16,011
You made Dicko so very angry.

188
00:14:16,713 --> 00:14:18,013
[gasps]

189
00:14:18,088 --> 00:14:20,008
[Dicko] Silly fucking girl.

190
00:14:21,338 --> 00:14:23,758
Was your pride really worth it?

191
00:14:23,838 --> 00:14:27,048
[gurgling] Neat... trick.

192
00:14:36,421 --> 00:14:39,421
[gurgling] Not... good... enough.
[Sonnie coughs and laughs]

193
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:46,460
[Dicko] What are you?

194
00:14:46,546 --> 00:14:51,666
[gurgling] Just a couple of
bioware processors

195
00:14:51,755 --> 00:14:54,045
spliced to a spine.

196
00:14:54,838 --> 00:14:56,378
You're not in there?

197
00:14:56,463 --> 00:14:57,673
[Sonnie] <i>No.</i>

198
00:14:57,755 --> 00:14:59,755
<i>The night Wes and Ivrina found me,</i>

199
00:14:59,838 --> 00:15:01,548
<i>they managed to save that body,</i>

200
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:04,130
<i>but those estate fucks
had broken my skull.</i>

201
00:15:05,005 --> 00:15:06,875
<i>You wanna know my edge?</i>

202
00:15:06,963 --> 00:15:10,843
<i>Every time I step into that ring, I'm
fighting for my life. That fear is my edge.</i>

203
00:15:15,171 --> 00:15:16,881
[gasps] Ahh!

204
00:15:18,338 --> 00:15:22,048
- [Dicko groans]
- [Sonnie] <i>That fear of death.</i>

205
00:15:23,296 --> 00:15:25,666
<i>- Do you feel it?</i>
<i>- </i>[growls]

206
00:15:25,755 --> 00:15:27,045
Please!
