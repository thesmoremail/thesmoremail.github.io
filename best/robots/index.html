<pre>
[propeller thumping]
[door slams]
[woman] Wes, you're a beaut.
She's purring like a kitten in there.
<a href="robotsS1E1-03;15.jpg"><img src="robotsS1E1-03;15_tn.jpg" alt="bot1" width=25% style="float:right;" class="lazy"/></a>
Gonna run those tests again.
[Wes] Link's strong.
None of those glitches we had last time.
[woman] That last wetware update
seems to have cleared that up.

Yeah, maybe. But I really think
we should... Oh! [chuckles]
- Hello?
- [woman] Yeah?
[Ivrina] There a problem?
- [woman] Can we help you?
- [man] My apologies.

Our little evenings
have become quite popular.
<a href="robotsS1E1-06;46.jpg"><img src="robotsS1E1-06;46_tn.jpg" alt="bot1" width=25% style="float:right;" class="lazy"/></a>
Arthur, their appearance fee.
[Wes] Oh, thank you.

Might I have a peek?

I've heard so much.

Yes. He's magnificent!

Yes. She is.
[man] Oh.

Of course, my apologies, "she".
<a href="robotsS1E1-06;55.jpg"><img src="robotsS1E1-06;55_tn.jpg" alt="bot1" width=25% style="float:right;" class="lazy"/></a>
What would you say if I asked you
to lose tonight's match?

Fuck off.

There's no need to get angry, my dear.
- It's just business.
- [woman 1] Not to me.
[woman 1] I don't dive...

and I don't lose.

And what makes you so special?

I'm not special.
<a href="robotsS1E1-07;12.jpg"><img src="robotsS1E1-07;12_tn.jpg" alt="bot1" width=25% style="float:right;" class="lazy"/></a>
Unique.

No other team uses a female pilot
for their beastie.
[coughing] That's it, then?

Your edge.

Women fight better than men.
- This one does.
- [woman 2] Yeah.

That's my girl.
- Seventeen straight wins to prove it.
- You'll be handsomely paid, of course.
<a href="robotsS1E1-07;43.jpg"><img src="robotsS1E1-07;43_tn.jpg" alt="bot1" width=25% style="float:right;" class="lazy"/></a>
You don't fucking listen, do you?

It may be about money for you,
but for us, it's personal.

Five hundred thousand.

No.
- One insignificant loss for more money...
- Insignificant?
...than you could ever win?
[exhales angrily] Fucking men.
<a href="robotsS1E1-09;39.jpg"><img src="robotsS1E1-09;39_tn.jpg" alt="bot1" width=25% style="float:right;" class="lazy"/></a>
It's cunts like you that
fucked her up to begin with.
[sighs] Fuck.

A year ago,
<i>Sonnie got snatched by an estate gang</i>
<i>and when they was done using her,</i>
<i>they started cutting,</i>
<i>- slicing their marks into her flesh.</i>
- [man laughing in the distance]
<i>Can you imagine that kind of pain,</i>
<i>- that kind of humiliation</i><a href="robotsS1E1-10;04.jpg"><img src="robotsS1E1-10;04_tn.jpg" alt="bot1" width=25% style="float:right;" class="lazy"/></a>
- [woman shrieks]
<i>carved into her skin?</i>
<i>A lifelong reminder of that day.</i>
<i>So when Sonnie steps into the pit,
she's not fighting for pride or status</i>
<i>and certainly not for your fucking money.</i>

She's carving up the men
who did this to her.

Very well, then.
<a href="robotsS1E1-10;11.jpg"><img src="robotsS1E1-10;11_tn.jpg" alt="bot1" width=25% style="float:right;" class="lazy"/></a>
I won't press you further.

Piece of shit.

Though I hope you'll reconsider.
[distant hubbub]
[rhythmic stomping]
[audience cheering loudly]
- [man roaring]
- [audience cheering]
<a href="robotsS1E1-10;46.jpg"><img src="robotsS1E1-10;46_tn.jpg" alt="bot1" width=25% style="float:right;" class="lazy"/></a>
What a sweet little girl.

You're going down...

down...

down... [roars]

You okay in there?
[opponent roars]
[cheering]
<a href="robotsS1E1-11;40.jpg"><img src="robotsS1E1-11;40_tn.jpg" alt="bot1" width=25% style="float:right;" class="lazy"/></a>
Tonight is the big night

of the big fight!

Brutal beasties in a bout to the death!

Gore...
- [shouting] gore galore!
- [cheering]

Affinity link is booted, Sonnie.
<a href="robotsS1E1-11;44.jpg"><img src="robotsS1E1-11;44_tn.jpg" alt="bot1" width=25% style="float:right;" class="lazy"/></a>
You ready to get in there?
[announcer] <i>Comin' in</i>
<i>on a hot winning streak...</i>

She's up and running.
- I give you...
- And on the move.
[shouting] ...Khanivore!
[screeches]
[roars]

Look out!
[growls]
[announcer] Can you hear that?
<a href="robotsS1E1-11;50.jpg"><img src="robotsS1E1-11;50_tn.jpg" alt="bot1" width=25% style="float:right;" class="lazy"/></a>
What's coming down...
- Yeah!
- ...to tear up the town?
[shouting] It's Turboraptor!
- [roars]
- [cheering]

Are... you... ready?
[audience applauds and cheers]
[roars]
[roars]
[pained growl]
- [audience cheering]
- [growling]

Fucking yeah!
[grunts] Fucking little cunt!
[roars]
[audience cheers]
[pained howl]

Get 'im!
- [audience cheers loudly]
- [growls]

Surprise, motherfuckers!

Her heart rate's spiking!
[panicked shouting]
[shrieks]
[growls]
[pained snarl]
[shouting] Come on, motherfucker!
[pained roar]
[bones crunching]
[audience cheering]
- What is that?
- Fuck me.
[low growling]
[muted roar]
[silence]
[silence]
[audience cheers loudly]

Yes!
[man] Sonnie!

Sonnie, you're a beauty!

Fuck.
[roars]
[audience cheers loudly]
You wanker!

Fuck you!
[audience chanting] Khanivore!
[audience continues to chant]
- [man] Oh, no!
- [woman] Steady on there, little man.
[Wes] Think they got
someone to clean that up?
[Ivrina] I don't think
anyone cares, mate.

Well, I might give it five minutes
and if they don't, I will.
- [Ivrina] It's a shit-hole.
- [Wes] That arm. What was that?
[Ivrina] <i>Cheating, that's what it was.</i>
[Wes]<i> But it was made of bone.</i>
<i>That's not against the rules, is it?</i>
[Ivrina] <i>Yeah, I just wanna know how they</i>
<i>engineered that solid piece, that's all.</i>

You thought we were gonna
lose tonight, didn't you?

Can I help you?
[gasps]

This place is...

amazing.

You were amazing.

Thanks.

Look, why are you with...

Dicko?

Security.

Right.

Ever thought of leaving him?

Sometimes.

All the time.

You could come with us.

No. [laughs]
No, I couldn't.

I envy you.

Your bravery.

I'm maybe even
a little bit frightened of you...

but I'll never be like you.
[gasps] Oh!

How do you do it, all this...

fighting and hatred?
- Aren't you scared?
- Scared?

All the time.

Now, hate...

that was something I had to learn.

You don't come into this world with hate,
- [woman panting] - but fear,
- that's primal.
- [woman sighs]
- It fills your senses.
- [woman sighs]

You can see it, hear it...

taste it...

and it keeps me alive.

But that night, the gang, the...

Rape.
Yeah.

It's not that.

They can't see past it.

No one can.

But it ain't what gives me my edge.

Angry little girl, out for revenge.

Dicko believes that shit...
'cause he wants to.

They all do.

Everyone sees what they want to see.
[sighs]
[sighs]
- [gurgling]
- [cane tapping]
[Dicko] Are you scared now?
[groans and gurgles]
[pained grunt]

You made Dicko so very angry.
[gasps]
[Dicko] Silly fucking girl.

Was your pride really worth it?
[gurgling] Neat... trick.
[gurgling] Not... good... enough.
[Sonnie coughs and laughs]
[Dicko] What are you?
[gurgling] Just a couple of
bioware processors

spliced to a spine.

You're not in there?
[Sonnie] <i>No.</i>
<i>The night Wes and Ivrina found me,</i>
<i>they managed to save that body,</i>
<i>but those estate fucks
had broken my skull.</i>
<i>You wanna know my edge?</i>
<i>Every time I step into that ring, I'm
fighting for my life. That fear is my edge.</i>
[gasps] Ahh!
- [Dicko groans]
- [Sonnie] <i>That fear of death.</i>
<i>- Do you feel it?</i>
<i>- </i>[growls]

Please!

54
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:03,505
<i>So when Sonnie steps into the pit,
she's not fighting for pride or status</i>

55
00:04:03,588 --> 00:04:06,798
<i>and certainly not for your fucking money.</i>

56
00:04:07,755 --> 00:04:11,335
She's carving up the men
who did this to her.

57
00:04:13,296 --> 00:04:14,706
Very well, then.

58
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:16,835
I won't press you further.

59
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:19,670
Piece of shit.

60
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:27,340
Though I hope you'll reconsider.

61

65
00:05:16,171 --> 00:05:17,921
What a sweet little girl.

66
00:05:18,713 --> 00:05:20,263
You're going down...

67
00:05:21,046 --> 00:05:22,046
down...

68
00:05:22,296 --> 00:05:26,756
down... [roars]

69
00:05:27,005 --> 00:05:28,005
You okay in there?

of the big fight!

74
00:05:43,921 --> 00:05:48,671
Brutal beasties in a bout to the death!

75
00:05:50,046 --> 00:05:51,126
Gore...

76
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:54,670
- [shouting] gore galore!
- [cheering]

77
00:05:54,755 --> 00:05:56,455
Affinity link is booted, Sonnie.

78
00:05:56,546 --> 00:05:58,046
You ready to get in there?

[announcer] <i>Comin' in</i>

00:06:17,338 --> 00:06:20,298
- I give you...
- And on the move.

82
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:23,585
[shouting] ...Khanivore!

[growls]

87
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:38,336
[announcer] Can you hear that?

88
00:06:40,005 --> 00:06:44,795
What's coming down...

89
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:49,050
- Yeah!
- ...to tear up the town?

90
00:06:49,505 --> 00:06:53,795

[audience cheers loudly]

121
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,920
Yes!

122
00:10:06,963 --> 00:10:08,633
[man] Sonnie!

123

Sonnie, you're a beauty!

Fuck.

You wanker!

127

Fuck you!

128

[audience chanting] Khanivore!

129

[audience continues to chant]

130
00:10:29,213 --> 00:10:31,513
- [man] Oh, no!
- [woman] Steady on there, little man.

131
00:10:31,588 --> 00:10:33,458
[Wes] Think they got
someone to clean that up?

132
00:10:33,546 --> 00:10:35,206
[Ivrina] I don't think
anyone cares, mate.

133
00:10:35,296 --> 00:10:38,296
Well, I might give it five minutes
and if they don't, I will.

134
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:40,960
- [Ivrina] It's a shit-hole.
- [Wes] That arm. What was that?

135
00:10:41,088 --> 00:10:42,708
[Ivrina] <i>Cheating, that's what it was.</i>

136
00:10:42,796 --> 00:10:45,397
[Wes]<i> But it was made of bone.</i>
<i>That's not against the rules, is it?</i>

137
00:10:45,421 --> 00:10:48,606
[Ivrina] <i>Yeah, I just wanna know how they</i>
<i>engineered that solid piece, that's all.</i>

138
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:50,760
You thought we were gonna
lose tonight, didn't you?

139
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:03,130
Can I help you?
[gasps]

140
00:11:05,213 --> 00:11:07,263
This place is...

141
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:09,130
amazing.

142
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:13,301
You were amazing.

143
00:11:13,713 --> 00:11:14,713
Thanks.

144
00:11:15,421 --> 00:11:17,961
Look, why are you with...

145
00:11:18,046 --> 00:11:19,046
Dicko?

146
00:11:20,546 --> 00:11:21,956
Security.

147
00:11:23,046 --> 00:11:24,046
Right.

148
00:11:25,296 --> 00:11:26,666
Ever thought of leaving him?

149
00:11:27,171 --> 00:11:28,171
Sometimes.

150
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:30,760
All the time.

151
00:11:32,088 --> 00:11:33,628
You could come with us.

152
00:11:35,338 --> 00:11:38,418
No. [laughs]
No, I couldn't.

153
00:11:40,046 --> 00:11:41,046
I envy you.

154
00:11:41,963 --> 00:11:43,343
Your bravery.

155
00:11:44,213 --> 00:11:47,093
I'm maybe even
a little bit frightened of you...

156
00:11:49,713 --> 00:11:51,553
but I'll never be like you.

157
00:12:00,463 --> 00:12:02,053
[gasps] Oh!

158
00:12:06,463 --> 00:12:09,093
How do you do it, all this...

159
00:12:09,671 --> 00:12:11,921
fighting and hatred?

160
00:12:12,005 --> 00:12:14,165
- Aren't you scared?
- Scared?

161
00:12:16,171 --> 00:12:17,511
All the time.

162
00:12:18,588 --> 00:12:19,838
Now, hate...

163
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:22,840
that was something I had to learn.

164
00:12:23,921 --> 00:12:26,721
You don't come into this world with hate,
- [woman panting] - but fear,

165
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:30,710
- that's primal.
- [woman sighs]

166
00:12:31,713 --> 00:12:33,593
- It fills your senses.
- [woman sighs]

167
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:37,550
You can see it, hear it...

168
00:12:41,088 --> 00:12:42,208
taste it...

169
00:12:44,588 --> 00:12:46,798
and it keeps me alive.

170
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:54,760
But that night, the gang, the...

171
00:12:56,838 --> 00:12:57,878
Rape.
Yeah.

172
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,380
It's not that.

173
00:13:04,546 --> 00:13:05,586
They can't see past it.

174
00:13:07,713 --> 00:13:08,923
No one can.

175
00:13:10,796 --> 00:13:12,756
But it ain't what gives me my edge.

176
00:13:13,796 --> 00:13:16,416
Angry little girl, out for revenge.

177
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:18,553
Dicko believes that shit...

178
00:13:20,213 --> 00:13:21,803
'cause he wants to.

179
00:13:23,671 --> 00:13:24,841
They all do.

180
00:13:31,421 --> 00:13:33,841
Everyone sees what they want to see.

181
00:13:37,963 --> 00:13:39,303
[sighs]

182
00:13:51,421 --> 00:13:52,421
[sighs]

183
00:14:00,463 --> 00:14:02,963
- [gurgling]
- [cane tapping]

184
00:14:03,046 --> 00:14:04,916
[Dicko] Are you scared now?

185
00:14:09,421 --> 00:14:10,591
[groans and gurgles]

186
00:14:11,005 --> 00:14:12,085
[pained grunt]

187
00:14:12,171 --> 00:14:16,011
You made Dicko so very angry.

188
00:14:16,713 --> 00:14:18,013
[gasps]

189
00:14:18,088 --> 00:14:20,008
[Dicko] Silly fucking girl.

190
00:14:21,338 --> 00:14:23,758
Was your pride really worth it?

191
00:14:23,838 --> 00:14:27,048
[gurgling] Neat... trick.

192
00:14:36,421 --> 00:14:39,421
[gurgling] Not... good... enough.
[Sonnie coughs and laughs]

193
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:46,460
[Dicko] What are you?

194
00:14:46,546 --> 00:14:51,666
[gurgling] Just a couple of
bioware processors

195
00:14:51,755 --> 00:14:54,045
spliced to a spine.

196
00:14:54,838 --> 00:14:56,378
You're not in there?

197
00:14:56,463 --> 00:14:57,673
[Sonnie] <i>No.</i>

198
00:14:57,755 --> 00:14:59,755
<i>The night Wes and Ivrina found me,</i>

199
00:14:59,838 --> 00:15:01,548
<i>they managed to save that body,</i>

200
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:04,130
<i>but those estate fucks
had broken my skull.</i>

201
00:15:05,005 --> 00:15:06,875
<i>You wanna know my edge?</i>

202
00:15:06,963 --> 00:15:10,843
<i>Every time I step into that ring, I'm
fighting for my life. That fear is my edge.</i>

203
00:15:15,171 --> 00:15:16,881
[gasps] Ahh!

204
00:15:18,338 --> 00:15:22,048
- [Dicko groans]
- [Sonnie] <i>That fear of death.</i>

205
00:15:23,296 --> 00:15:25,666
<i>- Do you feel it?</i>
<i>- </i>[growls]

206
00:15:25,755 --> 00:15:27,045
Please!
