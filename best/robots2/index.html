<pre>
﻿[eerie ethereal music plays]
[metallic rattling]
[gears whirring and clanking]
[in a male voice]
Uh... we are fucking lost, aren't we?
[in a male voice]
Lost? Okay, that's rich. <a href="1.jpg"><img data-src="1_tn.jpg" alt="bot1" width=25% style="float:right;" class="lazy"/></a>

Let's see,
we just passed the ravaged church.

There is the blood pit.
[laughs] This way. Here we go.
[In a female voice]
Breathtaking.
- It's more beautiful than the brochures.
- [camera clicks]
[robot 2] Come on. Giddy up, guys!
We've got so much to see.
[robot 1] You've seen
one post-apocalyptic city,

you've seen 'em all.
[jazzy music plays]
[robot 3] You're looking good, girl. <a data-src="2.jpg"><img src="2_tn.jpg" alt="bot1" width=25% style="float:right;" class="lazy"/></a>
Say "terabyte".
[chanting] Go, team.
[robot 2] Hey, guys, stop goofing around
and check this out.
- Behold the entertainment sphere!
- [drum roll]
[robot 3] It's called a ball.

I know it's called a ball,
but I'm trying to get into the whole
"we're experiencing these human things
for the first time" vibe.

And what did humans do with these things?

Oh, man, what <i>didn't </i>they do?
They'd bounce them.
- That's it?
- Yeah. That's pretty much it.

These were humans.

Bouncing things was close to<a href="3.jpg"><img data-src="3_tn.jpg" alt="bot1" width=25% style="float:right;" class="lazy"/></a>
maxing out their cognitive range.

No, but also sometimes they would take
the ball and hit it with, like, a stick.

What? When they misbehaved?

Bad ball. Think about what you've done.

Come on, here. Try.

What the hell am I supposed to do
with this thing?

You know, boing-boing.

No way.

Stop being a whiny pussy<a href="13.jpg"><img data-src="13_tn.jpg" alt="bot1" width=25% style="float:right;" class="lazy"/></a>
and fucking bounce it.
- Please.
- Jeez, calm down your motherboard.
- Okay.
- Oh, man, this is so exciting.

Oh! That was amazing!
How was it for you? Tell me everything.

It was pretty anticlimactic.
[robot 3] Yeah, well, welcome to humans.
[robot 3] Show me what you've got,
big boy.
- [electric crackling]
- [country ballad plays]
<i>♪ Oh, won't you help pick up the pieces ♪</i>
<i>♪ Of a broken heart ♪</i>

Now, I'm not certain, but my understanding
is that they would shove these

into their intake orifices
to generate power.<a href="4.jpg"><img data-src="4_tn.jpg" alt="bot1" width=25% style="float:right;" class="lazy"/></a>

Why would you need
an entire orifice for that?

Who knows? They had all sorts of orifices.

Things were coming in,
things were going out. It was crazy!

I mean, I have a fusion battery for power.
[robot 3] We all have fusion batteries,
dummy.

That's my point.
What more do you need, right?

So, let me get this straight.

They would shove these
into their intake orifice,

and then what?
Somebody help me out here.
[robot 3] Their intake orifices<a href="5.jpg"><img data-src="5_tn.jpg" alt="bot1" width=25% style="float:right;" class="lazy"/></a>
had rocky pegs

that would crush them into paste,

and then the paste would be forced
into an internal vat of acid.

Well, of course.
That makes perfect sense.

They could have just dumped this thing
into an exterior vat of acid to begin with

and then they wouldn't need
the rocky pegs. I mean, duh!

Expecting logic from beings
who have internal vats of acid
- is a little much.
- It's crazy. Who even designed them?<a href="6.jpg"><img data-src="6_tn.jpg" alt="bot1" width=25% style="float:right;" class="lazy"/></a>

It's unclear. We checked their code -
no creator signature.

That's because they were made by
an unfathomable deity that created them

for no apparent reason, out of dust.

Just kidding.
They came from a very warm soup.

Sorry for the wait, champ.

♪ <i>And then somebody new set the... ♪</i>

What's the point of this thing?

Apparently, there's no point.
They just had them.

Well, that's underselling their influence.

They had an entire network that was
devoted to dissemination of pictures

of these things.
[cat growls]
[robot 1] Oh, look, it's doing something.<a href="7.jpg"><img data-src="7_tn.jpg" alt="bot1" width=25% style="float:right;" class="lazy"/></a>

It's coming this way.
- [cat meows]
- What the fuck does it think it's doing?
- Dude, what do I do?
- Okay, easy. No sudden moves.

Let's just wait until it decides
to get up again, okay, bud?
- We're gonna get through this.
- How long will that take?

Hours. Perhaps years.

I don't have hours
or perhaps years for this.

What if you try to irritate it by moving
your digits across its keratinous fibers?
- Maybe that'll make it move.
- What? Why?
- I don't know. It couldn't hurt.
- You don't have any idea, do you?

I do not. It is my first time<a href="8.jpg"><img data-src="8_tn.jpg" alt="bot1" width=25% style="float:right;" class="lazy"/></a>
seeing one of these live!

Hey, just try it, though.
- Okay, fine.
- [cat purrs]
[robot 3] Is it working?
- Uhh...
- What?

There's a strange, rhythmic kind of noise
that's emanating from it now.
- Uh-oh.
- What do you mean, "uh-oh?"

I don't want you to panic or anything,
but I think you've activated it.
[robot 1] What does that mean?

As I said, I am no expert,<a href="9.jpg"><img data-src="9_tn.jpg" alt="bot1" width=25% style="float:right;" class="lazy"/></a>

but if the noise ever stops,
it's gonna explode on you.
[laughs] It is not. Is it?

Cursory historical research shows

that humans had a card game called
<i>Exploding Kittens.</i>

So, yes, this checks out.
- Oh, you're gonna die now. Bummer.
- [robot 1] What?

Why did humans even consort
with these hairy murder machines?
- Kindred spirits?
- Also checks out.

No, seriously. Now what?

Say "terabyte".<a href="10.jpg"><img data-src="10_tn.jpg" alt="bot1" width=25% style="float:right;" class="lazy"/></a>
[camera clicks]

Wait, it's called what now?

It's an X Bot Three, an early
computer entertainment system for humans.
- Any relation?
- To me? Come on. No way.

You sure? 'Cause numerically,
it suggests that this is your ancestor

maybe a few thousand generations back.

Numerically, I'm sure
it's just a coincidence.

We are robots. We don't do coincidence.

Go on, call it Daddy.
- Okay, stop. Just stop.
- Or Mommy.<a href="11.jpg"><img data-src="11_tn.jpg" alt="bot1" width=25% style="float:right;" class="lazy"/></a>

Either is equally applicable
in as much as we don't have genitalia.

Do you have an off button?
[mimicking mother] Son, you're skin
and bones. Are you recharging properly?
- I will disintegrate you!
- Not with that cat with you, you aren't.
[cat meows]

You want us to turn it on?

No fucking way.

I'm agreeing with X Bot 4000 here.
- Right!
- One thing is to joke about ancestry,

another to see your grandfather
heaving its hard drives in front of you.

Yes, especially when your
ancestor's entire existence<a href="12.jpg"><img data-src="12_tn.jpg" alt="bot1" width=25% style="float:right;" class="lazy"/></a>

was defined by
thirteen-year-old human males

using it to teabag opponents
in virtual battles.

Slow down. "Teabag", what does that mean?
- Nothing.
- No, it has to mean something.
- He said a word. I'm gonna look it up.
- Don't look it up.
- I am looking it up now.
- Yeah. Please do.
- You'll be sorry.
- <i>You'll </i>be sorry.

Here it is. What?
What the hell is this horrible practice?
- Why did you make me look this up?
- I told you not to.

And the memory of this has been burned
into my circuits forever

and you must be punished.
- Huh! Cat-bagged!
- [cat meows]
<a href="13.jpg"><img data-src="13_tn.jpg" alt="bot1" width=25% style="float:right;" class="lazy"/></a>
Come on! That's cold, dude.

You deserved it.

I'm sure your ancestors
are very proud of you right now.
[robot 3] Out of curiosity, what do you
trace your ancestry back to?

Oh, I'm glad you asked.

I come from a proud, long line
of baby monitors.

Not many babies around anymore, right?

Yeah, we kind of sucked at our job.
[cat meows]

All right, <i>mein </i>bots,
this is the last stop of the tour,

and may I say, the <i>pièce </i>of resistance.<a href="14.jpg"><img data-src="14_tn.jpg" alt="bot1" width=25% style="float:right;" class="lazy"/></a>
[robot 3] Is it me,
or this thing screams "phallus"?

Hmm. What was it for?
[robot 3] The idea behind these was to
annihilate as many humans as possible,

as quick as possible.

This exercise suddenly got
a little dark, didn't it?

Well, to be fair,
they only used these a few times.

To be fair,
you would only need a few times.
- Also fair.
- This is the thing that killed them all?

No. Indeed, it was their own hubris
that ended their reign,

their belief that they were
the pinnacle of creation

that caused them to poison the water,
kill the land and choke the sky.

In the end, no nuclear winter was needed,<a href="15.jpg"><img data-src="15_tn.jpg" alt="bot1" width=25% style="float:right;" class="lazy"/></a>

just the long heedless autumn
of their own self-regard.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, sorry.

Thought that would
sound better than,
"Nah, they just screwed themselves
by being a bunch of morons."

Yeah, you can't just
crack one of those off.

You've got to warn us.
[robot 3] Tip for next time.

I understand now.

Humans died out from
environmental disaster.

Yeah, pretty much.

And also because at one point,
they genetically engineered their cats

to give them opposable thumbs.
[cat] Yes. Once we could open up
our own tuna cans,

that was pretty much that
for the human race.

Seems pretty heartless.

Gentlemen, I'm a cat.

Just to clarify, you are not going <a href="16.jpg"><img data-src="16_tn.jpg" alt="bot1" width=25% style="float:right;" class="lazy"/></a>
to explode if we stop petting you, right?

I didn't say that.

You guys better keep petting me
just to be sure.

Forever. Good.

Now, lower.

Oh, by the way, I brought some friends.
[cats meow]
- [robot 1] Oh, fuck me.
- [camera clicks]
[cat] Yes. Oh, that's nice.

I said lower.

00:03:54,755 --> 00:03:56,795
[robot 3] Their intake orifices
had rocky pegs

56
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,460
that would crush them into paste,

57
00:03:58,546 --> 00:04:01,206
and then the paste would be forced
into an internal vat of acid.

58
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:04,420
Well, of course.
That makes perfect sense.

59
00:04:04,505 --> 00:04:08,415
They could have just dumped this thing
into an exterior vat of acid to begin with

60
00:04:08,505 --> 00:04:11,665
and then they wouldn't need
the rocky pegs. I mean, duh!

61
00:04:11,755 --> 00:04:15,125
Expecting logic from beings
who have internal vats of acid

62
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:18,803
- is a little much.
- It's crazy. Who even designed them?

63
00:04:18,921 --> 00:04:22,761
It's unclear. We checked their code -
no creator signature.

64
00:04:22,838 --> 00:04:25,878
That's because they were made by
an unfathomable deity that created them

65
00:04:25,963 --> 00:04:28,053
for no apparent reason, out of dust.

66
00:04:29,296 --> 00:04:32,086
Just kidding.
They came from a very warm soup.

67
00:04:32,463 --> 00:04:34,093
Sorry for the wait, champ.

68
00:04:35,338 --> 00:04:39,508
♪ <i>And then somebody new set the... ♪</i>

69
00:04:41,671 --> 00:04:43,301
What's the point of this thing?

70
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:46,010
Apparently, there's no point.
They just had them.

71
00:04:46,088 --> 00:04:48,548
Well, that's underselling their influence.

72
00:04:48,796 --> 00:04:52,506
They had an entire network that was
devoted to dissemination of pictures

73
00:04:52,588 --> 00:04:53,588
of these things.

74
00:04:54,338 --> 00:04:55,958
[cat growls]

75
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:57,796
[robot 1] Oh, look, it's doing something.

76
00:04:59,213 --> 00:05:00,553
It's coming this way.

77
00:05:01,463 --> 00:05:04,133
- [cat meows]
- What the fuck does it think it's doing?

78
00:05:05,588 --> 00:05:08,798
- Dude, what do I do?
- Okay, easy. No sudden moves.

79
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,231
Let's just wait until it decides
to get up again, okay, bud?

80
00:05:11,255 --> 00:05:13,481
- We're gonna get through this.
- How long will that take?

81
00:05:13,505 --> 00:05:15,335
Hours. Perhaps years.

82
00:05:15,421 --> 00:05:18,211
I don't have hours
or perhaps years for this.

83
00:05:18,296 --> 00:05:22,756
What if you try to irritate it by moving
your digits across its keratinous fibers?

84
00:05:22,838 --> 00:05:25,298
- Maybe that'll make it move.
- What? Why?

85
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:28,380
- I don't know. It couldn't hurt.
- You don't have any idea, do you?

86
00:05:28,463 --> 00:05:31,673
I do not. It is my first time
seeing one of these live!

87
00:05:31,755 --> 00:05:32,955
Hey, just try it, though.

88
00:05:33,338 --> 00:05:36,048
- Okay, fine.
- [cat purrs]

89
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:37,380
[robot 3] Is it working?

90
00:05:37,421 --> 00:05:38,761
- Uhh...
- What?

91
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:43,955
There's a strange, rhythmic kind of noise
that's emanating from it now.

92
00:05:44,046 --> 00:05:46,956
- Uh-oh.
- What do you mean, "uh-oh?"

93
00:05:47,046 --> 00:05:50,416
I don't want you to panic or anything,
but I think you've activated it.

94
00:05:50,505 --> 00:05:52,005
[robot 1] What does that mean?

95
00:05:52,088 --> 00:05:53,758
As I said, I am no expert,

96
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:57,960
but if the noise ever stops,
it's gonna explode on you.

97
00:05:58,046 --> 00:06:01,046
[laughs] It is not. Is it?

98
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:03,130
Cursory historical research shows

99
00:06:03,213 --> 00:06:06,173
that humans had a card game called
<i>Exploding Kittens.</i>

100
00:06:06,255 --> 00:06:08,295
So, yes, this checks out.

101
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:11,630
- Oh, you're gonna die now. Bummer.
- [robot 1] What?

102
00:06:11,963 --> 00:06:16,173
Why did humans even consort
with these hairy murder machines?

103
00:06:16,255 --> 00:06:18,415
- Kindred spirits?
- Also checks out.

104
00:06:18,505 --> 00:06:20,415
No, seriously. Now what?

105
00:06:22,255 --> 00:06:23,835
Say "terabyte".

106
00:06:23,963 --> 00:06:24,963
[camera clicks]

107
00:06:27,338 --> 00:06:29,128
Wait, it's called what now?

108
00:06:29,213 --> 00:06:33,713
It's an X Bot Three, an early
computer entertainment system for humans.

109
00:06:34,088 --> 00:06:37,008
- Any relation?
- To me? Come on. No way.

110
00:06:37,088 --> 00:06:40,208
You sure? 'Cause numerically,
it suggests that this is your ancestor

111
00:06:40,296 --> 00:06:42,126
maybe a few thousand generations back.

112
00:06:42,338 --> 00:06:44,918
Numerically, I'm sure
it's just a coincidence.

113
00:06:45,005 --> 00:06:47,795
We are robots. We don't do coincidence.

114
00:06:48,255 --> 00:06:49,915
Go on, call it Daddy.

115
00:06:50,005 --> 00:06:52,125
- Okay, stop. Just stop.
- Or Mommy.

116
00:06:52,213 --> 00:06:55,713
Either is equally applicable
in as much as we don't have genitalia.

117
00:06:55,796 --> 00:06:57,256
Do you have an off button?

118
00:06:57,338 --> 00:07:01,168
[mimicking mother] Son, you're skin
and bones. Are you recharging properly?

119
00:07:01,255 --> 00:07:05,205
- I will disintegrate you!
- Not with that cat with you, you aren't.

120
00:07:06,213 --> 00:07:07,213
[cat meows]

121
00:07:07,255 --> 00:07:08,835
You want us to turn it on?

122
00:07:08,921 --> 00:07:10,631
No fucking way.

123
00:07:10,713 --> 00:07:13,173
I'm agreeing with X Bot 4000 here.

124
00:07:13,255 --> 00:07:15,255
- Right!
- One thing is to joke about ancestry,

125
00:07:15,338 --> 00:07:19,168
another to see your grandfather
heaving its hard drives in front of you.

126
00:07:19,255 --> 00:07:22,005
Yes, especially when your
ancestor's entire existence

127
00:07:22,088 --> 00:07:24,168
was defined by
thirteen-year-old human males

128
00:07:24,255 --> 00:07:27,255
using it to teabag opponents
in virtual battles.

129
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,670
Slow down. "Teabag", what does that mean?

130
00:07:29,755 --> 00:07:31,395
- Nothing.
- No, it has to mean something.

131
00:07:31,421 --> 00:07:33,731
- He said a word. I'm gonna look it up.
- Don't look it up.

132
00:07:33,755 --> 00:07:35,585
- I am looking it up now.
- Yeah. Please do.

133
00:07:35,671 --> 00:07:37,761
- You'll be sorry.
- <i>You'll </i>be sorry.

134
00:07:38,671 --> 00:07:42,301
Here it is. What?
What the hell is this horrible practice?

135
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:44,481
- Why did you make me look this up?
- I told you not to.

136
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:47,375
And the memory of this has been burned
into my circuits forever

137
00:07:47,463 --> 00:07:49,423
and you must be punished.

138
00:07:50,546 --> 00:07:52,546
- Huh! Cat-bagged!
- [cat meows]

139
00:07:52,755 --> 00:07:54,955
Come on! That's cold, dude.

140
00:07:55,046 --> 00:07:56,046
You deserved it.

141
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:58,670
I'm sure your ancestors
are very proud of you right now.

142
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:10,510
[robot 3] Out of curiosity, what do you
trace your ancestry back to?

143
00:08:10,588 --> 00:08:11,708
Oh, I'm glad you asked.

144
00:08:11,796 --> 00:08:15,126
I come from a proud, long line
of baby monitors.

145
00:08:15,213 --> 00:08:17,673
Not many babies around anymore, right?

146
00:08:17,755 --> 00:08:19,625
Yeah, we kind of sucked at our job.

147
00:08:22,088 --> 00:08:23,338
[cat meows]

148
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:29,878
All right, <i>mein </i>bots,
this is the last stop of the tour,

149
00:08:29,963 --> 00:08:33,383
and may I say, the <i>pièce </i>of resistance.

150
00:08:35,671 --> 00:08:38,051
[robot 3] Is it me,
or this thing screams "phallus"?

151
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:39,590
Hmm. What was it for?

152
00:08:39,671 --> 00:08:43,381
[robot 3] The idea behind these was to
annihilate as many humans as possible,

153
00:08:43,463 --> 00:08:44,713
as quick as possible.

154
00:08:44,796 --> 00:08:47,206
This exercise suddenly got
a little dark, didn't it?

155
00:08:47,338 --> 00:08:50,128
Well, to be fair,
they only used these a few times.

156
00:08:50,255 --> 00:08:53,005
To be fair,
you would only need a few times.

157
00:08:53,088 --> 00:08:55,588
- Also fair.
- This is the thing that killed them all?

158
00:08:55,671 --> 00:08:59,011
No. Indeed, it was their own hubris
that ended their reign,

159
00:08:59,088 --> 00:09:01,798
their belief that they were
the pinnacle of creation

160
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:05,880
that caused them to poison the water,
kill the land and choke the sky.

161
00:09:05,963 --> 00:09:08,513
In the end, no nuclear winter was needed,

162
00:09:08,588 --> 00:09:11,838
just the long heedless autumn
of their own self-regard.

163
00:09:11,921 --> 00:09:14,801
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, sorry.

164
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,420
Thought that would
sound better than,

165
00:09:16,505 --> 00:09:20,125
"Nah, they just screwed themselves
by being a bunch of morons."

166
00:09:20,213 --> 00:09:22,053
Yeah, you can't just
crack one of those off.

167
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:23,170
You've got to warn us.

168
00:09:23,255 --> 00:09:24,545
[robot 3] Tip for next time.

169
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:25,840
I understand now.

170
00:09:25,921 --> 00:09:28,881
Humans died out from
environmental disaster.

171
00:09:29,005 --> 00:09:30,335
Yeah, pretty much.

172
00:09:30,421 --> 00:09:34,131
And also because at one point,
they genetically engineered their cats

173
00:09:34,213 --> 00:09:36,173
to give them opposable thumbs.

174
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:39,455
[cat] Yes. Once we could open up
our own tuna cans,

175
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:42,420
that was pretty much that
for the human race.

176
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,260
Seems pretty heartless.

177
00:09:44,338 --> 00:09:46,008
Gentlemen, I'm a cat.

178
00:09:47,005 --> 00:09:51,505
Just to clarify, you are not going
to explode if we stop petting you, right?

179
00:09:52,296 --> 00:09:53,626
I didn't say that.

180
00:09:53,755 --> 00:09:56,585
You guys better keep petting me
just to be sure.

181
00:09:56,671 --> 00:09:58,801
Forever. Good.

182
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,130
Now, lower.

183
00:10:00,421 --> 00:10:02,341
Oh, by the way, I brought some friends.

184
00:10:02,421 --> 00:10:03,551
[cats meow]

185
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:05,840
- [robot 1] Oh, fuck me.
- [camera clicks]

186
00:10:06,963 --> 00:10:10,303
[cat] Yes. Oh, that's nice.

187
00:10:10,921 --> 00:10:12,381
I said lower.
