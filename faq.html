<h2><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Frequently</span> Asked Questions</h2>
<ul id="faq-list">
<li><strong>How much does sMoreMail cost?</strong>
<p>sMoreMail is free.</p></li>

<li><strong>How does sMoreMail work?</strong>
<p>sMoreMail uses visitor submitted information as an interactive computer service.  sMoreMail visitors identify and catalog public web pages that may send an email when a web form is submitted.  Using sMoreMail you can request that your email address be paired with these forms to get inbound email.</p></li>

<li><strong>Where do I get help?</strong>
<p>This FAQ is your help - unlesss you want to talk with fellow users, make your way way over to the <a href=/best/chat/>sMoreMail user Chat</a></p></li>

<li><strong>How do I keep from being a victim to Malicious Email?</strong>
<p>Use sMoreMail to train your spam filters. If you are not an IT professional you can still learn at: <a href=/best/email/>Email Schenanigan protection</a></p></li>

<li><strong>Can I submit and article?</strong>
     <p>Sure Can! see: <a href=/best/addarticle/>Submit Article</a></p></li>

<li><strong>What is with the crazie spelling your team uses?</strong>
<p>You will notice a host of spelling issues throughout the sMoreMail echosystem that have been intentionally placed to direct crawlers and search engine to index our content for suitable discoverery by the intended audience.  
     Oddly enough, we have found the properly spelled pages are not indexed in a manner that is helpful to our intended audience.</a></p></li>

<li><strong>Who in their right mind would try to toast their inbox and fill it with email?</strong>
<p>sMoreMail users find many uses for inbound email.  These can including testing your email server, verifying and training your spam filters, 
     learning what other bulk email looks like, or finding something new to read.  Because of the large volume of potential email, sMoreMail does not condone using other people's 
     email address with this service.  Please treat other people's email with respect and don't sign them up for spam regardless of how much you think it would be funny.</p></li>

<li><strong>Why do I have to allow popups to run sMoreMail?</strong>
<p>Other techniques like iframes aren't as reliable and if the destination pages choose to rewrite the URL, you'd lose progress on sMoreMail.</p></li>

<li><strong>Is my browser and IP information hidden from websites I submit my data to using sMoreMail?</strong>
<p>No. Your browser submitted data including referrer headers, and IP address are submitted with your requests.</p></li>
    
<li><strong>Can I enter my primary email address into sMoreMail?</strong>
<p>Yes. You can use sMoreMail with any email address that is yours.  It is recommended you create a separate email address to use with sMoreMail and then discontinue the email account when you are done reviewing the email.  Some sources of email may continue to email addresses you've enter into sMoreMail even if you are no longer using sMoreMail.</p></li>

<li><strong>Can I enter my personal information into sMoreMail?</strong>
<p>Yes, but hold up a second. While sMoreMail tends to work best if you have each field of information filled in, you are not required, or encouraged to enter personal information as sMoreMail has no idea how some websites use the information you submit. Consider using generic information perhaps from a <a href="http://www.fakenamegenerator.com/">fake name generator</a>.</p></li>

<li><strong>How do I remove my web form from being indexed by sMoreMail?</strong>
<p>sMoreMail uses visitor submitted information as an interactive computer service.  This service is provided 'as is' with no warranty.  If your website has been indexed by a visitor, and you wish visitors from sMoreMail to not interact with your page, you can change the page url, implement CAPTCHA, or implement a mechanism to reject form submissions from visitors that originate from sMoreMail.</p></li>

<li><strong>Can I use sMoreMail if I'm younger then 18?</strong>
<p>No. If you are under 18 years of age you may not use sMoreMail.  While we don't actively publish adult content and will remove it if it's discovered, sMoreMail uses visitor submitted information as an interactive computer service.  Because it is possible the submitted information can link to adult material, children may not use sMoreMail.  Futhermore, in some juristictions you're not able to aggree to the terms of use or privacy policies before a specific age - so, there's that.</p></li>

<li><strong>Can I enter another person's email address or information into sMoreMail.</strong>
<p>No. You may not use sMoreMail if you are soliciting email through sMoreMail for an email address that is not yours.</p></li>

<li><strong>Why build sMoreMail?</strong>
<p>A good tool to request lots of email from public sources did not exist before 2006.  (well, there was a recent one, but we worked out a liscencing agreement, which explains some overlap in our content.)</p></li>

<li><strong>Can I have a feature like [insert request here]?</strong>
<p>If you have a <a href="/login.html">paid account</a> or are <a href="http://eepurl.com/gcDkcL">on the mailing list</a> with sMoreMail, your feedback may be requested on features you want.  More features are planned.</p></li>

<li><strong>Cookies?</strong>
<p>Milk?  No.  Just kidding.  <Br/>Yup sMoreMail uses cookies for core content, ads, tracking, games, enhanced user experiences, and all around magic-smoke-summoning and wizardry.  Block cookies at the browser level or with an addin if you don't want them, <a href="/privacypolicy.html"> review and delete your local cookies and storage directly from the privacy policy and statement</a>, or don't use sMoreMail.  If you take off, we are sad to see you go, but not sad enough to break half the internet or it's RFCs supporting the best-practice of allowing you and your computer to store your data (as opposed to stuffing your data into some corporate/cloud server, fingerprinting your browser to host cookieless sessions, and not telling you about it).</p></li>

<li><strong>What's with the User Submitted Articles?</strong>
<p>sMoreMail gladly partners with it's users in publishing their observations and insights.  Some articles have overlap into the concept of spam and machine generated email, and others are more broad in topic.  You're encouraged to submit your insights at <a href="/best/addarticle/">Add Article</a></p></li>
